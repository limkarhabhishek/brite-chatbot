progesterone by nature is the great Calmar. And not many hormones do that. I mean, what hormones do that? Possibly melatonin, but namely one other hormone that is the great, calmer, and sometimes women have extraordinary calm for many times during their nine months of pregnancy. And biochemically, so much of that is due to this tremendous amount of progesterone that's circulating, calms them, and another major quality of progesterone that balances the stimulatory effects of oestrogen. So the design is have adequate estrogens for the proper amount of stimulation, and have adequate progesterone to balance that stimulation which can play out for example, in the breast, and it can so much affect the excessive amount of oestrogen that some women you can treat increased breast density increased breast tenderness, increased breast fullness that can occur because of oestrogen dominance, with direct topical application of progesterone to the breasts. Now, I say some, and not all, because progesterone will also reinstitute adequate oestrogen sensitivity to the oestrogen receptor sites. And in those women, they're gonna get breast tenderness by applying progesterone directly to the breast. So you always want to when you have a woman with fibrocystic, breast disease, or the onset of breast tenderness, you can say now we're going to try and we're going to try something, it may or may not be work work when it works, it's great. That is you're going to apply progesterone right to your breasts, but sometimes it doesn't do exactly what we want it to for very good and understandable reasons. So we'll see how it goes. But it's a wonderful remedy when it works. And it doesn't super sensitise the oestrogen receptor sites in breast glandular tissue, so you get increased sensitivity and increased back pain. So caution, some women will have increased breast pain from direct application of progesterone to the breasts. It's never stopped me from doing that experiment. But I'm full of caveats. And I'm saying let's be paying a lot of attention. We definitely are not going to accept increase in breast tenderness. So if you've been getting into it, stop applying it to your breasts. Dr. John Lee, definitely the father, so to speak of making the world aware, the medical world aware of the need for progesterone. Again, he spoke about that optimal hormone function is based on adequate progesterone. And again, think of that midcycle temperature increase. Let's talk about progesterone and Boehm. The subject is progesterone. What's this progesterone doing? And this is an article by someone that I think it's good to know in this field of progesterone and the field of menopause is Dr. Geralyn Pryor is one of the things that she's written is one of the seminal articles on osteoporosis and progesterone. And I'd like to actually zero in on some of the details that she's saying that estradiol and progesterone they collaborate on and remodelling bone, both on resorption. And that's oestrogen based. Adequate oestrogen slows down the osteo class slows them down. So you don't get excessive osteoclast activity. And then progesterone has to do with bone formation, newborn formation, I mean, how many biochemicals Can you name where that biochemical promotes the action of osteoblasts? Those bone cells that lay down new bone? I actually don't know only one of them as far as hormones go, and that is progesterone. Now there's many things that other hormones that affect bones beneficially, that's for sure thyroid does the androgens do so many things play into the health of bones and then doctor prior saying that they're showing evidence that progesterone that's what p four is may prevent. And with the antiresorptive Treat women's osteoporosis. So she's proposing treating women who have osteoporosis with progesterone, and oh, she's making this little additional thing saying antiresorptive. What's an antiresorptive? Well, something that slowed down the reabsorption of bone. And what's nature's anti reabsorbed of? Its oestrogen. So I always thought it was a little funny that she would use the word antiresorptive as rather than use the word oestrogen. But there are other things that have come upon the market. These pharmaceutical agents that slow down reabsorption, and again before stimulates osteoblast differentiation in vitro. And a meta analysis of five studies confirms that regular cycling pre menopausal women lose bone mineral acity related to subclinical ambulatory disturbances, subclinical auditory disturbances, disturbance and ambulation, one of the prime fallouts of IV LaTorre disturbances is zero to minimal to not the right amount of progesterone production. So not getting consistent ovulation not getting consistent formation of the corpus luteum not getting sufficient progesterone output, you get loss of bone mineral density. Again, many ways to look at how progesterone relates to proper bone mineral density. And then she's also saying that before prevents bone loss that's progesterone in pre and possibly Peri menopausal women, progesterone co therapy with the antiresorptive. This may increase bone formation and bone mineral density. And here are the anti resorptive is number one oestrogen, and then the SERMs the selective oestrogen receptor site modulators why wouldn't want to use a sirm when you've got oestrogen? Well, there are some issues where that is to be considered at least, and then the bisphosphonates and the calcitonin and monoclonal antibodies, that's where the pharmaceutical industry went to the bisphosphonates to effect and slow down bone reabsorption. And then here's an article and I'm selecting articles in your ears definitely find more in your references, and in the appendix, but the administration of progesterone produces mild sedative like effects in men and women. And I mentioned this before to you I believe, that if we were to inject intravenously into my veins or any woman or any man's veins, the proper amount of progesterone, we could be put into asleep so deep surgery can be performed on us Namie one other hormones that you can do with the possible exception of melatonin is going to put you to sleep. That is the great calmer, that's the sedative like effect. And so the corollary to that is, if a woman loses her progesterone, the likelihood of her having sleep disturbances quite significant. So the administration of progesterone produces a mild Sen like effect in men and women in certain metabolites and progesterone, allo pregnenolone, for example, are potent positive allosteric modulators of GABA and that's what I was getting to. We're bringing in GABA and GABA a receptors and that produces a set of like effect, certainly in laboratory animals. So these results suggest that progesterone its metabolites can produce a sedative like and I'd like to add calming like effect in both men and women. Women who are leading good lives and don't have excessive stress and they get into the pre menopause and they started having anxiety when they say I don't understand why I've got a good life. You're gonna hear this. You doing goes the bell in your mind. It went off in our room hear that? Oh, maybe she's getting into progesterone insufficiency. Let's give it a try. Now, there's even other beneficial effects to progesterone, neuro protective effects. So what this article is delineating those neuro protective and neuro regenerative written neuro regenerative effects of progesterone, oh my goodness, it's being used in trauma, traumatic brain injury. And here's an article on that moderate traumatic brain injury. Survivors who receive progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomised to placebo, progesterone for the brain and recovery from brain injury.
