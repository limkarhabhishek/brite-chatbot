I'm showing you this is a path report of a patient of mine that I had been treating for several years. When we she felt a lump we had it examined, and ultimately a lumpectomy was performed along with radiation. And it wasn't infiltrating ductal carcinoma quarterly, why am I showing you this? Practice menopause medicine medicine long enough, and you're liable to confront a patient who has breast cancer. So, from here on out, I'm going to be flashing references on the screen. And I just want to show you how I'm going to do that. The first slide is going to contain the title or the general subject of the reference the excerpt from the article, the main point is going to be in that excerpt, and also the literature citation so that you can go back and delve into that if you'd like to, and then that very quickly is going to be followed by a second slide. So don't be concerned about having to linger on that first slide. Because the second slide, I'm going to really focus in on the main point that I wanted to say that that article really revealed to us and then when you see one of these diamonds, you'll see that there's going to be additional references available in the appendix. And then for those of you who would like I can send you some additional references there in my book in there 86 of the pristine references that I've garnered out of almost 1000 references that relate to menopause. Well, there's the common knowledge about risks in menopause medicine, there's they may relate to hormones, and you've seen these things. They're they related to age, the older women have a higher risk the age of minarchy. The later the onset of menarche, the less the risk none of these are absolute though, the use of birth control pill the lowest risk is if a woman never use birth control and there is a higher risk with a previous or current birth control pill users. The age of the first parity less than 20 is a benefit over over someone who gets pregnant for the first time over 30 You're familiar with these breastfeeding confers a lower risk as does multipolarity, and then oophorectomy and the age of oophorectomy in the age of menopause and oestrogen treatment. Well, oh, look at that. Women treated with Premarin alone. They have a relative risk of 0.79. That's less than one that's less than a woman who's untreated. It was the oestrogen progestin combination called prempro. It in the Women's Health Initiative turned out to have a confer a relative risk, not a high one, but a definitely statistically significant one of 1.29. Thus, greater than a woman who went untreated, postmenopausal BMI can make a difference as in a family history of breast cancer 10% of the women who have a family history of a near relative we're talking mom and something like that. I have an increased risk of breast density. Yes, I've already mentioned that that is an actual risk factor. And that's coming from that data and also bone density. I mean, someone with the best bone density has a higher risk because they probably have higher estrogens, and progesterone and testosterone, ionising radiation, alcohol. These are the common ones you know about it and here's a reference to the mammographic density. And again, here is what I want to call from that article. There is now extensive evidence that mammographic density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer that is associated with large relative and attributable risks for the disease. And I like to delve into this issue of breast density because you you're going to encounter it, and there's stuff that you can do about it. And there's the Boyd classification. And they see it the denser the breast, the greater the risk. And the relative risk in a very dense breast can be up to five times the risk of someone who has no increased breast density. And here's how breast cancer risk can relate to postmenopausal hormone treatment. Oh, that's germane. And this is a review article. So the data sources for this review include Medline, the Cochrane Database, and there'll be individual citations of course, and this is the approach to the two arms of the Women's Health Initiative study. This is going back and reviewing this in depth. And what does it say that the Premarin arm alone the conjugated equine, oestrogen, see ease, and there was a second arm of that study, as many of you know, and that was with prempro that conjugated equine estrogens plus a, quote progestin that progesterone, which was medroxyprogesterone acetate, and the average risk of invasive breast cancer with oestrogen use alone is immense. In just moments ago was 0.79 primer alone relative risk 0.79 Less than a woman who was untreated. Now the average risk of breast cancer and this which made this study blow up with the use of prempro, the oestrogen progestin was 1.24. This is why so much attention has been paid to the subject of risk. Premarin 0.79, prempro 1.24 Here's a mainstream view by Michelle Warren, and it's an endo text and what she is saying here pointing out that I thought was so Germaine is that oestrogen is a trophic growth hormone, and it may promote the growth of a pre existing breast cancer, it is still unknown whether it may also induce the growth of new cancers, promotes the growth of a pre existing breast cancer, especially a well differentiated breast cancer that has oestrogen receptor sites and progesterone receptor sites and it looks very much like the breast glandular tissue from what you've derived. Now, many studies have not shown an increase of breast cancer with oestrogen use. This is a reference that 20 view if there was one reference, I would have you refer to the original. Its medical doctor named Ken Holtorf, who did a review article asking the question, are bioidentical hormones safer or more efficacious? And it's in postgraduate medicine. It's one of the landmark articles on this subject. And it's a review in this literature review presents the substantial evidence for the safety and efficacy of bioidentical hormone therapy, and I'm quoting from the article, including estradiol estriol, and progesterone, which shows that it presents lower risk for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease than synthetic or animal derived hormones. For further references, I refer you to the appendix which I will not be reviewing in the videoing of this, but you will have as a resource to refer to as far as genetic polymorphisms. One woman out of 10, who have known inherited risk factors will actually be vulnerable to breast cancer. This is an important issue that faces us as physicians and nurse practitioners who are going to be working with women in menopause. And it has to do with the age of onset related to the age of diagnosis with breast cancer, it occurs, there's a 10 to 15 year gap between the first genetic aberration that leads ultimately to a tumour, that first cell to something that's identifiable by palpation or buy a mammogram or whatever screening techniques, you're using 10 to 15 year gap. So for example, the age of diagnosis of a woman could be 45. That meant that the age of onset for her was 30 or 3510 to 15 years prior to the age of detection. And so when you get older, for example, when you get to the 55 to 64, the 65 to 74 you're always dealing with something that began 10 to 15 years earlier. So what does that mean? It's a split, it puts practitioners who are dealing in menopause it has we have a special vulnerability as it relates to menopause practice and the onset of breast cancer, because the age of onset is going to be between most commonly between 30 and 45. And the age of diagnoses for breast cancer and the women who do get it is going to be between 45 and 55 and that is the very age that you are going to be encountering your patient for treatment of menopause. So I want to talk about this special vulnerability
