Are there risks with androgens? Well, here's an article in cardiovascular in cancer safety of testosterone in women. Well, testosterone is inversely associated with increased cardiovascular disease in women. Wow. That means the more normal the testosterone, the less the cardiovascular risk. Oh yeah. The relationship between testosterone and breast cancer remains unclear, although a clear signal of risk has not emerged from the studies of women treated with testosterone therapy over the past decade. So here's more on the sex steroids and breast cancer in the takeaway is that relatively consistent positive associations have been observed between testosterone or free testosterone levels in breast cancer risk. These associations are of a similar magnitude to those confirmed among postmenopausal women. My question is, and of course, this was commenting and pre menopausal women are testosterone levels being assessed with 24 hour urine hormone tests. So this information is a bit incomplete for me. And then regarding cancer safety of testosterone and women is an additional node as it is possible for testosterone to aromatize to estradiol hormone testing when administering testosterone as always is imperative. And this provides excellent assessment of any hormonal excess that could relate to overstimulation of breast glandular tissue. Here it is, again, well, this is why we're testing women. And here's an interesting relationship between serum testosterone levels and cell proliferation. And the takeaway is that our findings in healthy women confirm previous reports of an anti proliferative effect of androgens in breast tissue. And our finding in breast cancer patients suggests that this anti proliferative effect may be mediated via downregulation of the progesterone receptor. Whoa, yeah. It this is what the medical literature has so much of it in is cases for cases against and again, when we are dealing with breast cancer, my goodness gracious, the number of possible causes are there so many of them that you know, to pin it down to a single hormone that's not present in excessive dosages, and even present and excessive doses. It's just not good science. It's not good medicine. Here's the relationship of circulating sex steroids in breast cancer risk in pre menopausal women. The estrogens relationships are both positive and no associations the progesterone both inverse and now associations meaning their studies that show yeah, the more the progesterone, the less the incidence of breast cancer. There's also no associations. The oestrogen metabolites, there's both inverse and no associations. The complexity of measuring oestrogen in different phases of the menstrual cycle may have contributed to the inconsistencies in the literature. And there is the challenge here there's inconsistencies in the literature. As far as DHEA and DHTs. It's inconclusive, although you may know that many women it's thought to have benefit from taking DHEA and even after they've had breast cancer. And testosterone is relatively consistent with positive associations as far as total and free similar to those Association postmenopausal women DHEA transdermal can be optimal way to our x the absorption be good or not good. And when you do treat with Janice termos, you do 100 milligrammes per millilitre, organic oil base, there's not other concentrations to remember there, and that'll give you four milligrammes per drop, and then you can also get 10 milligrammes per gramme, or 30 milligrammes per gramme, examples of a gel preparation, and they could come in a pump bottle if one half gramme or one half ML is what is dispensed each time, then you're getting five milligrammes or 15 milligrammes with each pump, and again, test especially if you are going to go outside 10 milligrammes per day, because you can get into excessive levels of non youthful levels above youthful levels of DHEA. The region to apply transdermal DHEA is similar to that of testosterone. And again, the oral dose parameters are somewhere between five and 15 milligrammes a day you'll figure it out women to women, if a woman has decent weight, that does not mean it's not thin, I'll start them on 50 milligrammes a day and that will be that'll carry them, often for years and years. If they're thinner, I might go to 10 milligrammes and then often I have to tweak the DHEA often because it was a bit much, and so we're lower that dose, and then you can see DHEA is everything else not being metabolised, as well, the older women gets so you can get you can see increases in DHEA and women who are on the same dose year after year. The deal is if you're testing annually, you're gonna pick these things up. And you're gonna keep these dosages into optimal ranges. When I test this is other doctors do this differently. When I test DHEA, I have them not omit. Don't omit it, because in some laboratory instructions, it's going to say if you're taking oral hormones omit the oral hormone the night before plus the night of. And the reason is, there's such a profound first pass effect with all these hormones. But I actually want to see the real amount of DHEA, that their kidneys thus their bloodstream is are seeing. So I advise not to omit oral DHEA, and not to omit oral progesterone. Yeah, you take all your hormones, like you usually do when you're collecting urine for the 24 hour urine hormone test. And a cost saving device, if you're doing oral DHEA is you can combine it within within a capsule of progesterone. When you titrate, the progesterone to the optimal dose test for it. Also do that independently with the DHEA. And then combine them and you can take them HS it's more than the DHEA that you get day after day after day after day. This is going to determine your level. So I'm content with giving DHEA in the evening, and I'm also content with it because I have women on that and they're doing fine. They have no agitation. You know, theoretically there could be increased energy at night if you're giving DHEA at night because it can be a prelude to testosterone and oestrogen that these are animators. But I haven't run into that. And although Surely I will with some sensitive woman some day. And again, yeah, you combine them into a single dose per capsule because most of the cost of compounding happens to be in the labour and they usually charge the same for whatever's within a single capsule. And sometimes they charge a little more when they combine androgen journey. Once again in summary, the androgen depletion takes place over time. The androgens maybe adequate in the perimenopause or not. Restoring androgens, DHEA and testosterone are important in menopause a woman very much so for those in advanced age. Oh yeah. And dose determination with testosterone is based on symptoms. But you always confirm clinical improvement by testing. And all hormones matter. Androgens are their own adventure and oh yes, they're so important.
