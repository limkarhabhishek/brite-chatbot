Now I want to talk about a quirk that can happen with progesterone. And it happens to be overload of the oestrogen receptor sites by excessive progesterone. Well, here we are, we're, this is this topic that's going to reappear for every hormone and periodically it's going to be don't do overdose. Know what overdose is? Know how to determine it. Testing. That's how you determine it. You can get clues by the amount of people are using but mainly testing 24 hour urine hormone testing is going to reveal it every time. Now oestrogen absolutely binds best of any biochemical you can name to the oestrogen receptor site. But other things bind to the oestrogen receptor site as well. Progesterone does, for example, much weaker. So when you administer a dose of balanced progesterone, and oestrogen, there's three p's and threes. The progesterone is going to go to the progesterone receptor site, illustrated in blue, and the oestrogen is going to go to the oestrogen receptor site, because that's where the affinity and specificity is absolutely the highest. But if you get in a situation where you have tremendous amount of progesterone that you're giving, and there was oestrogen in the receptors there oestrogen receptor sites, and you give an excessive dose of progesterone, by the law of mass action, you're going to knock that oestrogen right out of the receptor site, again, not by affinity. But by the law of mass action when there's far more substrate, then you can change the biochemistry of things that can change the chemistry of things. So the moral of the story is, know what excessive doses of progesterone are. And when you're wondering why you're getting hot flashes, if you've ruled out the common reasons, don't forget to think about why am I giving an excessive amount of progesterone in relationship to the amount of oestrogen that she's getting? That's what I want to point out here. So beware of excessive progesterone dosage, causing symptoms of oestrogen deficiency. It's possible. Now there are unusual symptoms that can be relating to progesterone therapy, and it's over sensitivity, progesterone, and where are you going to see that and a woman who's gone many years without having progesterone, this is common in the history recognised women, women who have early and prior total hysterectomy. So again, like I was mentioning, some of them are given Premarin. And there's other reasons as well, there can even be an allergy to progesterone. And in which case, you can use the sensitization measures. And here would be an example of a young menstruating woman. And you're again, she has the proper amount of progesterone for the amount of HER receptor sites. Whereas if she's not seen progesterone for many years, and she's got doormen receptor sites, and you sort of give her a blast of progesterone treatment, you are going to overload those receptor sites and it's going to have the off opposite situation is going to have trouble because ordinarily, a progesterone is going to drift into a receptor site, do what it does with or interact within the receptor site, and then back out, so in and out, off. But when you've got my the matt law of mass action, you got an excessive amount of progesterone in the field, you can not get the off phenomena. So what am I telling you? This is another reason why a woman can have problems with progesterone. So what's the remedy? Start with a low dose and increase that dose very gradually. You're as respectful with progesterone as you are with oestrogen. And just to think about when you're administering progesterone, about 10% of administered oral progesterone is bioavailable. But 90% is metabolised to pregnant and dial in the first pass through the liver. There's a second pass, like when you apply progesterone transdermally are transmute coastally There is no first pass effect, it goes to the body first, and then it's picked up by the liver for metabolization to pregnant cow. But when you miss her by mouth, it goes to the liver first. And then it's metabolised. Most of it goes to first gets metabolised right away, never makes it to the body. So I'm just giving you an idea when you're administering a dose of progesterone, how much is actually making it to the full body. That's 100 milligramme dose of oral progesterone could lead to five to 10 milligrammes of circulating progesterone but how much do you need? The mid luteal output of ovarian progesterone in young menstruating woman is plus or minus 40 milligrammes that is not our goal. I'm just giving you some of the knowledge base. We're not trying to replicate young, youthful levels of oestrogen or progesterone or testosterone. It's not necessary to achieve these robust useful mid luteal levels in treating a menopausal woman. No way. And not only that, we're not Just giving a woman in menopause, progesterone during the mid luteal phase. Why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we want to copy nature because we've done that experiment. It doesn't work that way. Once a woman goes into pre menopause and she's applying hormones, transdermally they behave a lot different. And I'll have more to say about that. So it's a steady dose thing. We've tried the other experiment of changing the doses to to mimic the menstrual curves of both oestrogen and progesterone. Well, that's not how it works out practically, which makes it easy because women in menopause they're gonna play the same dose every day of oestrogen and progesterone. They may alter that dose up or down if there's circumstances in their life, leading to additional stress or sleep issues. And they are going to stop once a month. And we'll get into that, but we're not going to follow those menstrual curves
