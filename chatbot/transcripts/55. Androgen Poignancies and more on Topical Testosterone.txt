So pointed sees about the androgens testosterone must be given orally must, you can get into difficulty with the liver testosterone can be adverse to the liver and testosterone usually absorbed really well transdermally the organic oils mix it works beautifully, and at times it does not. And when it does not, you have to go to trans external Piri anal mucosa that can be a better site. And of course, as I've already mentioned, the internal labia Bonora or the intro vaginally can be an excellent site and you dose determined by starting low and gradually increasing and you confirm by testing and DHEA may or may not absorb well transdermally and it can be given orally somewhere between five and 15 milligrammes for most patients, and as Alan gave me once told me, no one should be given over 15 milligrammes of DHEA, orally a day, and I find this bear out by testing, so, if you're gonna go over 50 milligrammes a day, be sure you're testing and it's too common out there in the streets to find DHEA produced by supplement companies that are 25 milligrammes. So, yes, I've tested a lot of women with DHEA and don't want to give them higher than 15 milligrammes certainly without 24 hour urine hormone testing. DHEA doesn't have the built in safeguards as far as symptoms of access. None of those are absolute like for oestrogen for example. Yeah, 75% of women who have excessive dose of oestrogen are going to get breast symptoms, breast fullness, nipple tenderness, nipple pain, breast tenderness, but a good 25% of them, that's rough figures that's coming out of my head around my own practice there. But you know, whatever the exact percentage is, that's something that you really want to pay attention to. That even though they're not having symptoms, they could be an overdose. And again, bottom line, follow the dose guidelines and test and you'll be fine. So I don't want to make any of this overcomplicated. If you pick up one thing, from all of this whole teaching programme, one thing only, if you do 24 hour urine hormone test, you're gonna just do great, and you'll figure out all of menopause. That was the biggest tool I had, along with my patients to figure out menopause was the 24 hour urine hormone test. So no matter how intricate this whole story gets, in how many different determinants there are, how you do this, you can abandon all of them if you commit to 24 hour urine hormone testing, because it'll teach you everything you need to know it'll keep those women safe. And it'll also keep them safe from underdose, which I showed you how prevalent that was. And now that you learn more about sarcopenia and ask the opinion, opinion, osteoporosis, not to mention the arteries, the cognition, cognitive function, the brain, all you have to do is test and you can treat women within the goalposts between eight and 14 micrograms per 24 hour total potent estrogens. If there's one thing for you to walk away with, that's the whole menopause safety guideline. In a nutshell, yes, DHEA not having symptoms, you can't dose determinate by symptoms. So you got to go to the testing, which you want to do anyway, it's usual that a woman will ply testosterone one time per day, usually in the morning, although there is an optimal time and that can be half hour before anticipated intercourse as it may enhance orgasm and it can be applied to the clitoris. And so you can apply it to the area that pubic hair are the external periodontal mucosa around the vagina, intra vaginally, the clitoris or the perineum. And again, the totally safe so as to not transmit to a partner is not intra vaginally, but there's definitely exceptions to that. And caution. If you do apply to these areas and you are gonna have intimate contact, your partner could absorb some extra hormone, and then I put it in there. It's so what is that a big deal. In most cases, it's not going to be a big deal. And unless you are having just this dramatically active sex life and all the more power to you and you can figure out another place to put your testosterone in that gaze. And one other caution with testosterone avoid applying it to an area of skin that has hair follicles because if you apply testosterone to where there is a hair follicle you can lead to hair growth in that individual area. Testosterone can be very valuable into vaginally for other reason, because it can be excellent in assisting the return to vaginal health. My favourites are estriol testosterone and DHEA is also used for that, if indicated for intra vaginal preparations are available in the organic oils and non alcoholic non astringent gels and in combination with STL for interventional treatment. The common strengths of testosterone for women are in the organic world space is five to 10 milligrammes per millilitre, I have gone higher and so Some instances, common starting dose for a gel is 1.6 milligrammes per gramme, or four milligrammes per millilitre. It's very rare that I find any occasion to use a gel. You can wait until the bias to progesterone stabilised before adding in androgen therapy as I have mentioned, and if you are going to add it in early on in the process, it's common to keep this those steady until the bias and progesterone are available. So as an example, if you gave a woman testosterone five milligrammes per millilitre, you might start around two drops in the morning of testosterone and just keep that stable. So she is because she is adjusting the biassed and the progesterone. So let her adjust that and keep her eye on that and just keep a steady dose of the testosterone if you're going to add DHEA as well. So just to get the milligrammes of course, is different than milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, there is no by test. It's one so, testosterone is always written in milligrammes per millilitre, and again, the most common starting dose that I started a woman off and my practice is five milligrammes per millilitre, with drops to QD, which turns out to be four tenths of a milligramme and it's common to treat with more aggressive 10 milligrammes per millilitre, and even more drops, especially as women get older and topical absorption diminishes. And once again, caution and applying androgens to area of the skin that have hair follicles, you may stimulate hair growth in unwanted places. In that original symptom card that women have there are symptoms of too little testosterone and too much testosterone because it is something that you can go suggest according to alleviating the symptoms of too little and falling shy of or backing down. Too much. I mean, too much testosterone. Women can get testosterone rich, they can get intense, they can get hyper, they can feel hyper aggressive. So these are not subtle, and many women have told me over the course of time of the excessive testosterone dosages, so too little is diminished libido. Now, there's more hormones involved in libido in women than just testosterone, oestrogen and progesterone certainly are involved. But you know, testosterone can be a very prominent one of these three hysteria hormones, the release libido and then you can get a loss of sense of security. So you got women are used to high function, and they're very successful in their lives and they start getting insecure. And there's no real reason to well, there could be a real reason to it could be that that that testosterone diminished, and restoration of it will bring that back pretty quickly. And another symptom or sign of too little testosterone is body hair loss, pubic hair loss, armpit hair loss don't have to shave as much. And also diminished energy and stamina. That's a big one in flabbiness. In muscular weakness, especially in the upper arms in the area of the triceps, in the thighs, the cheeks, the pelvis, the cheeks, the fall and cheeks of the elderly, and symptoms of too much. Women get hyper aggressive, they can get excessive oiliness of the skin and even pimples and acne. So that can come from both DHEA and testosterone. And they can get increased hair growth on the body in the face and or places of application or the risk with androgens. Well, here's an article on cardiovascular and cancer safety of testosterone and women. Well, testosterone is inversely associated with increased cardiovascular disease in women. Wow. That means the the more normal the testosterone, the less the cardiovascular risk. Oh yeah. The relationship between testosterone in breast cancer remains unclear, although a clear signal of risk is not emerged from the studies of women treated with testosterone therapy over the past decade. So here's more on the sex steroids and breast cancer in the takeaway is that relatively consistent positive associations have been observed between testosterone or free testosterone levels in breast cancer risk.

These associations are of a similar magnitude to those confirmed among postmenopausal women. My question is and of course, this was commenting on pre menopausal women are testosterone levels being assessed with 24 hour urine hormone tests. So this information is a bit incomplete for me. And then regarding cancer safety of testosterone in women, as an additional node, as it is possible for testosterone to aromatize to estradiol hormone testing when administering testosterone as always is imperative. And this provides excellent assessment of any hormonal excess that could relate to overstimulation of breast glandular tissue. Here it is, again, well, this is why we're testing women. And here's an interesting relationship between serum testosterone levels and cell proliferation. And the takeaway is that our findings and healthy women confirm previous reports of an anti proliferative effect of androgens in breast tissue, and are finding in breast cancer patients suggest that this anti proliferative effect may be mediated via downregulation Then the progesterone receptor. Hmm, yeah. It this is what the medical literature has so much of it in is cases for cases against and again, when we are dealing with breast cancer, my goodness gracious, the number of possible causes are, there's so many of them that you know, to pin it down to a single hormone that's not present in excessive dosages and even present and excessive doses. It's just not good science. It's not good medicine. Here's the relationship of circulating sex, steroids and breast cancer risk in pre menopausal women. The estrogens relationships are both positive and no associations the progesterone both inverse and no associations, meaning there's studies that show yeah, the more the progesterone, the less the incidence of breast cancer. There's also no associations. The oestrogen metabolites, there's both inverse and now associations. The complexity of measuring oestrogen in different phases of the menstrual cycle may have contributed to the inconsistencies in the literature. And there is the challenge here there's inconsistencies in the literature. As far as DHEA and DHTs. It's inconclusive, although you may know that many women it's thought to have benefit from taking DHEA and even after they've had breast cancer. And testosterone is relatively consistent with positive associations as far as total and free similar to those Association postmenopausal women DHEA transdermal is can be optimal way to RX the absorption be good or not good, and when you do treat with transdermal is you do 100 milligrammes per millilitre, organic oil base, there's not other concentrations, remember there, and that will give you four milligrammes per drop, and then you can also get 10 milligrammes per gramme, or 30 milligrammes per gramme, examples of a gel preparation, and they could come in a pump bottle if one half gramme or one half ML is what is dispensed each time, then you're getting five milligrammes or 15 milligrammes with each pump, and again, test especially if you are going to go outside 10 milligrammes per day, because you can get into excessive levels of non youthful levels above youthful levels of DHEA. The region to apply transdermal DHEA is similar to that of testosterone. And again, the oral dose parameters are somewhere between five and 15 milligrammes a day you'll figure it out women to women, if a woman has decent weight, that does not mean it's not, then I'll start them on 50 milligrammes a day, and that will be that'll carry them, often for years and years. If they're thinner, I might go to 10 milligrammes and then often I have to tweak the DHEA, often, because it was a bit much, and so we're lower that dose, and then you can see DHEA is everything else not being metabolised, as well, the older women get, so you can get, you can see increases in DHEA, and women who are on the same dose year after year, the deal is, if you're testing annually, you're gonna pick these things up. And you're gonna keep these dosages into optimal ranges. When I test and this is other doctors do this differently. When I test DHEA, I have them not omit don't omit it, because on some laboratory instructions, it's gonna say if you're taking oral hormones are met, or a hormone the night before plus the night of. And the reason is, there's such a profound first pass effect with all these hormones. But I actually want to see the real amount of DHEA that their kidneys thus their bloodstream is are seeing. So I advise not to omit oral DHEA and not to omit oral progesterone. Yeah, you take all your hormones like you usually do when you're collecting urine for the 24 hour urine or hormone test. And a cost saving device if you're doing oral DHEA is you can combine it with within a capsule of progesterone. When you titrate, the progesterone to the optimal dose test for it. Also do that independently with the DHEA. And then combine them and you can take them HS it's more of the DHEA that you get day after day after day after day. This is going to determine your level. So I'm content with giving DHEA in the evening, and I'm also content with it because I have women on that and they're doing fine. They have no agitation. You know, theoretically there could be increased energy at night if you're giving DHEA at night because it can be a prelude to testosterone and oestrogen birth. These are animators but I haven't run into that. And although Surely I will with some sensitive woman some day and again, yeah, you combine them into a single dose per capsule because most of the cost of compounding happens to be in the labour and they usually charge the same for whatever is within a single capsule. And sometimes they charge a little more when they combine androgen journey. Once again in summary, the androgen depletion takes place over time. The Andruw Jones may be adequate and the perimenopause or not restoring androgens. DHEA and testosterone are important in menopause a woman very much so for those in advanced age. Oh yeah. And those determination with testosterone is based on symptoms. But you always confirm clinical improvement by testing. And all hormones matter. Androgens are their own adventure and oh yes, they're so important.
