Sure, settle out about testing. And now I want to go in and describe the kind of testing and monitoring that I think is the very best to do. Let's talk about blood testing. For one thing, there's the basics, I always either have already from patient's primary physician, or do my own requisitions. For the basics that I want to see in every woman that's come into my office, I want to see of course, CBC, CMP, lipids, and some additional testing the thyroids and thyroids and very specific I like the least free T for Free T three TSH and reverse T three, primarily that reverse T three for the base camp because we're gonna get into treating so many women in menopause concurrently with thyroid hormone as well. Not all but many. And then I always get a basal sex hormone binding globulin. And there's other testing, they're important to me and my practice haemoglobin a one C and a fasting insulin, highly sensitive C reactive protein and homocysteine, FSH and LH. And then if I'm doing blood tests, and I'm ordering them, I will get a DHEA s and a testosterone for both free and total, because then I get to learn about the antigens prior to a woman entering hormone treatment. And if I don't have a DHEA s and testosterone, I won't bother to get it at that time. And there are other possibilities for sure. Oh, my goodness, we can do a lot of good blood tests. Now one thing if they arrive at my office, and they've got every one of these tests and even a lot more, but they don't have the sex hormone binding globulin, I'll still obtain a baseline sex hormone binding globulin. And we'll draw it or they have to go back to the their own drawing laboratory. Still going to get that sex hormone binding globulin for reasons that will become more apparent to you as I go. What about the serum, do we use it, I mean, we can test young and menstruating women with the serum, it works well enough, the challenges are more related to the timing of the cycle. You got to have a regular menstruating woman that's got an obvious midpoint and mid luteal. And then you can you can learn a lot from serum hormone tests. And the methods fortunately in the laboratory are shifting over to LCMS from the immune methods that they were using before. But in the peri menopausal women and the menopausal women that we're actually treating with hormones, you do the 24 hour urine hormone test, the serum tests are very limited. And what you do is the women are taking their hormones religiously for five days prior to plus during the test sample collection. And man, we're getting a real time readout of how these, these hormones are getting into a woman's body. And it's very unusual to test a woman in perimenopause or menopause initially, and we always get a serum hormone binding globulin test. And there's no possible value in FSH. So I'm always getting those these days. And I'll have more to say about that. Serum testing for women in menopause. There's too many issues. There's timing from when they took their last dose. I mean, are you going to test them at the two hour mark their peak? Are you going to test them 24 hours later? Are you going to test them at that one out? When are they peaking? Are you going to do a sequential test to see when when each of your individual patients are peaking and they're serving hormones? No, it's the 24 hour urine hormone test for a lot of reasons including the metabolites. I want to talk a little bit about FSH suppression and its effect on weight and bone. This is brand new information to me given to me by Dr. Jonathan Wright, and my goodness FSH regulates fat accumulation and redistribution. phatic regulates fat accumulation and redistribution in ageing through that following pathway there and FSH. This is the article in which it explains this and in fact, there's several articles here that is talking about how FSH follicle stimulating hormone is related to fat burning and bone building. Because what happens in the perimenopause is the general oestrogen levels start to drop. The body doesn't want that a woman's body doesn't like that. And through via the pituitary gland, it produces follicle stimulating hormone for the entire purpose of raising a declining oestrogen production back into reasonable ranges. And the interesting thing is, is these FSH is climb quite often when a woman stops menstruating entirely, and because she doesn't have enough oestrogen that FSH will climb to very high levels, relatively speaking. And the thing that shocked me is it never goes down. You think somewhere along the line, the body would get it and go okay, we're not going to have babies. We don't need the oestrogen let's just quiet down the FSH know. You test an 80 year old a nine year old you're gonna see elevate It FSH levels in here. What these articles are pointing out is that by blocking FSH, you can build bone and burn fat, Holy mackerel. In other words, FSH contributes to accumulating fat and to depleting bone. So that's what these articles are about. Now there's a wonderful natural FSH blocker. It's called estrogens. If you restore estrogens, the FSH going to fall. So it's point in is this particular piece of information is and they do suggest other pretty wild things to diminish that FSH including monoclonal antibodies. You don't need them nature's FSH. decliner is estrogens. Get the estrogens back up to reasonable wbfsh declines. I'd like to talk about the challenges of serum hormone testing in general and a woman in menopause. For a woman being treated with hormones, the time of preceding blood draw, and the preceding dose really matters. And I have talked about this. I apologise for the replication there. But the other thing about serum hormone testing, there is no metabolites. And the cost is very cost prohibitive if you're going to do an estradiol estriol and s drone, and the method that you choose the traditional methods are still pretty much based in the immune methods, although you can get LCMS now. And then there's the issues of the total estrogens versus the free estrogens. Because if you're going to do a serum test, you're gonna get a lot of bound estrogens. I have a lot more to say about this subject in the appendix. The moral of the story is 24 hour urine hormone testing. It's works perfectly. And in the instructions for the 24 hour urine hormone testing, I think it's very interesting. What we do is we gradually increase to the optimal dose. And when we think a patient has arrived at her optimal dose, and she'll tell you, she said my goodness, I feel so much better. When she arrives there clinically, we test 100% of the patients. So even though we test almost nobody at the beginning of our evaluation programme, there's no need to they're going to be low if they're in if they're in menopause. And it's going to be confusing if you test them in perimenopause, we test 100% when they've arrived at what we consider what they consider to be, hey, I feel so much better. We also will test during the dose determination process. If a case is challenging. Absolutely. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on. And then we'll test them you need the more information. And occasionally, occasionally we'll test at the onset, when patients seems to have more going on than the obvious. And when someone's a little sicker. Boy, I sure want to know what those corticosteroids are. Mainly, so we'll test those women, when they're especially tired, especially fatigue. And when a patient requests it. I've had women say to me, How in the world are you going to treat me unless you know what my hormone levels are? And I'll explain to them why we don't test in the beginning. But if they still go, gee, I stink and they don't get it. I say Sure. We'll test you got the financial resources. No problem. We'll test you in the beginning. Gotta watch out a little bit though, because of that perimenopause is far as hormone testing goes, it's important for you to know about and choose the optimal hormone testing method. You sure heard me sing the 24 hour urine hormone testing the song. And I sure haven't said much about the others. Because I know the answer to this one, at least I'm totally satisfied with myself, you may want to figure it out for yourself as well. You need to know about hormone testing what the reference range challenges are, and they do exist. And I'll elaborate on this and be able to distinguish between low analyte levels from high analyte levels so that you detect possible excessive treatment dosages, and possible, hormonal or dosage deficiencies. Both you're looking for access, you're looking for deficiencies. And then you also want to detect the metabolite issues because there is a relationship to risk. Here's the North American menopause society on their website, and what they have to say about hormone testing. What they're saying is don't do it. NAMS does not recommend hormone level testing. And really, they're talking about saliva testing, and they're talking about blood testing, because of the various issues that they have correctly identified. They are not thinking about these days. 24 hour urine hormone testing, made that change. It's one of our intentions to bridge this over to mainstream. That's where most women in the United States are going is to their traditional doctors. We want to help bring this information to them.
