I now like to describe to you how to apply these hormones topically, you know, this is something the patient needs, before they walk out the door, they not only need prescription they need instructions, because you've helped instruct them on dose determination. And now you want to instruct them on how to apply the hormones. And part of the menopause method is is we decided to automate this quite a while ago. And so you'll have the advantage of having that tool, but you might want to teach them how to apply these hormones, because it's definitely something that they need. So as far as applying bias, one of the best application sites for it is this soft forearm. It's got wonderful circulation, and it's got great absorption and bias. That's the number one place for bias. There's other places that you can apply by us. And they will also serve you when you go to eventually rotate sites with biassed the deltoid area of the shoulder, including the back part of the deltoid, the posterior deltoid, the lateral arm, that's not the medial arm, and the lateral forearm works as well. And we're not to apply that bias is in the soft forearm, the medial form, let's say you're getting out of a shower and you apply your hormone. And if you were to apply it there, you're so adjacent to that breast. Again, our desire is to reduce risks as close to zero as we possibly can. So we wouldn't want direct biassed application to the breast. That doesn't mean that's going to be problematic. But hey, we're going for reduce it as close to zero as we can get it so not to the soft arm. That's elbow to shoulder armpit really? And how about the lateral thigh? Yes, that's a good place to apply it. How about the buttocks? Well, if you're sharing a toilet seat with anyone, you don't want to apply it there. Because even though the transmission is going to be so minimal, especially if you let it absorb for a little bit, still, we're going further how close to zero can we reduce this risk and these hormones do transmit. So here's two different renditions of the it's the exact same woman and it's exact same instructions. The areas in red are were not to apply by us. Now it'd be the front of the torso near the breasts. And the inner arms. As I've already mentioned in the legs, the lower extremities. You know, there's women who have vein issues. And when you think about the birth control pills and where thrombophlebitis are used to affect them. I'm not sure which of the two in the birth control pills the Astra dial, you have to kneel Esther dial or the progestin. But women did get thrombophlebitis there. So we just leave the lower legs below the knee for no hormone application at all, with one exception. And then there's additional application possibilities for biassed women taught me this. They said, Well, I put the bias on my hand, for example, if I'm gonna rub it into my shoulder area, but I don't rub all of it off my hands, I save a little bit on my hands for rubbing into my face, neck and back a hands because it's so good for the skin. And this has been well known. I mean, what the public didn't know if some of the expensive skin creams actually put without listing on the label hormones in their oestrogen in there because it's so they're so good for the skin. That's why one of the main reasons why young women's skin looks so soft and so smooth. And why as women age, that skin changes and sometimes changes dramatically. And it's a lot a lot because loss of hormones. So women taught me this one. And you know, sometimes rarely, or occasionally, you can leave a little bit on your hands to apply to the soles of your feet. Now you're not going to get significant absorption from the soles of your feet. And that's not the intention. Having soft soles of the feet is a wonderful thing. And women have told me this as well. So applying some to the soles of your feet from time to time, a little residual on your hands to do that. That could be a good idea and some will do more, some will do less. So you can get that skin and stay soft or relatively soft progesterone, it's the same don't apply it to the legs, but you can apply it to the inner thighs that are in blue or on the model to the right. Those are notated by ovals and the abdomen is a good place for progesterone and the inner arms is a fine place for progesterone, a little progesterone and most women's breasts is just fine and not on the legs and the breast possibly as I mentioned before, a lot of women can reduce breast tenderness and reduce fibrocystic breast disease and thus mammographic breast density by application directly to the bras but some women that won't work well, because in the explanation that makes no sense to me is the progesterone is sensitising the oestrogen receptor sites to oestrogen And so they get more responsive to oestrogen. So you'll know who you are. If you apply progesterone to the breast, and your breasts get more tender, you'll know, you just don't do that. Now, we always want B ID application unbiased. And this is what happens when you apply B ID, let's say you apply the first dose at 8am, while you're gonna get a rather rapid rise in serum concentrations, and a gradual decline in time for a second application, and look at how high those peaks whereas if we were to apply it once a day, you're going to have to get a much higher peak because of a single application to get the general body levels are bias that you do want. Now, again, why are we taking this degree of care, and paying this attention to details, is we're trying to keep the risk as close to zero as we possibly can. And this is how we can actually control that because peaking on peaks is one of the things that's disturbing to the human body. So we want to distribute the incoming hormones to lesser peaks, and twice a day, it's practical, three or four times a day, it's just not practical. And then for the HS application of the progesterone, you know, it's HS so you are getting a peak with progesterone. But that's a very different type of hormone, as far as it doesn't stimulate like oestrogen does. And again, as I mentioned before, big application of progesterone is possible if desired. And then how about the timing during the topical application of bias and progesterone? Well, a woman's going to apply her bias and that's signified in red. In the morning, sometime, usually fairly close to getting up, though it doesn't really matter if you delay it till noon, even it doesn't matter. It's good on twice a day rhythm is probably optimal to keep the levels steady. And then the blue signifies when you apply the progesterone sometime it's sleep time, whenever that is. And then in practical time to apply the bias is at the same time you apply your nocturnal progesterone that makes it easy to remember. And easy to do. You're doing it at the same time. But some women just cannot take a bias that late in the evening that they can actually feel the stimulation from the oestrogen and that's not a bad thing. But if if they are stimulated, then that can interfere with their falling asleep. So those women have to apply their second application of bias earlier in the evening. How early you determine the dose? You did you determine the timing, because you'll know how long after you apply that bias that stimulation is no longer an issue. So you got to feel that went out. I've had women that have to apply that second dose is early as four o'clock in the afternoon. And many women can apply it later than that. Now, here's a principle that I do like to emphasise that we want these hormones stopped once a month. The reason is, if let's say that you apply it every day without stoppage. Well, what's the problem? Well, if it turns out, you're actually overdosing by even five molecules, something ridiculous like that a day, you're playing too much by five molecules, there's gonna come a time because these hormones are fat soluble, that you're going to bio accumulate the oestrogen or the progesterone or testosterone. And in order to prevent that we want this to copy nature to some extent on this one we want once a month stoppage so you want bioaccumulate. So once a month and the young woman's menstrual rhythm. Her hormone levels are very low. They're not that low. They don't women are nearly do not get hot flashes when their hormone levels drop.

But they do go quite low comparatively. So this is how we model the stoppage once a month of bias and progesterone and all hormones once a month. And the easiest day to stop is really stopping the first of the most don't don't apply your hormones in the first of the month. And then but it could be any day of the month. It doesn't have to be the first or some women who time this with the moon. And that's that's that can be fun to do, and keep you in cycle and rhythm with the moon. But it doesn't matter what day stop. We want you to stop. And then the question is, how many days of stoppage Do you want? Well, we have you stopped for the number of days that it takes for symptoms to develop. So let's say you stop your oestrogen and hormones on the first of the month. And on the second of the month. You're fine, you feel fine. The third of the month, which is the third day of stoppage you feel fine. But late in the afternoon, you get your first warm rush that tells you that you've depleted your oestrogen levels below a threshold. They've definitely dropped, they've even dropped lower than in the ordinary menstrual cycle because again, those women don't get warm rushes or nearly. And that tells us that mission accomplished you dropped your hormone levels low enough now. So that took three days to develop a symptom. So the following month and all subsequent nonces we have you stopped for two days, we don't need you to get the warm rush. In fact, once you create a symptom, it can be a little tricky to recovery, especially if you go so far as to get a hot flash. But that's how long you stop. So if you took three days to develop a symptom, you stopped for two days, every single month, if it took you four days to develop a symptom, you stopped for three days every month, five days, you stopped for four days, you get it one day less than the number of days it took you to develop a symptom of insufficiency. So what does that look like? Well, if you're just cruising along, taking progesterone and bias, for example, and along comes the first in the month, that's when you stop. And then how long do you stop? Well, you determine that, and then you resume after, you know, one day less than that onset of that first symptom. That goes for bias and progesterone. Now, some women have experiment with taking progesterone for not the full month, maybe just three weeks of the month. And some women have even gone to two weeks a month in an attempt to quote copy nature. But Dr. Wright and I have done experiments on this. And I hope to detail those experiments to you. And I tell you applying transdermal hormones, or taking hormones, by any route is not the same as the human ovary producing hormones. So the attempt or replicate nature is got its limitations, that's for sure. And so we're suggesting that you take your progesterone as many days as you take the bias, and then DHEA and testosterone, these are less subject. Testosterone still has a cycling to it, but not nearly as intense as oestrogen or progesterone. But we have just to make it easy. We have to stop all hormones for as many days as you've determined for the biassed a month. And then there you go, you've got a full month. And then you you stop again, the first next calendar month, or by the first of the new moon or the first of the full moon however, you're going to time this once a month you're stopping those hormones. And then another directive on hormone application is you rub rub rub rub rub. So if you put a drop on your arms, you rub your forearms together rub rub rub and it doesn't take long, especially with the organic oils. You'll notice the three rubs are already your skin's already dry. It's there's no issue there. But just rub them in so that there's not an oily or any kind of gel or cream film left there that you can feel and to is a wider area skin is possible. These are all little enhance absorption tricks, and rotate. Now in the initial phases of hormone dose determination, we suggest that you stick to the areas that we mentioned forearms for biassed abdomen or inner thighs for progesterone and we'll get to the androgens in a while. But after three months, four months start rotating so that you give a chance for the hormones that have embedded itself in the dermis of the skin to be taken up by the general circulation. It increases the lifespan of how long you can rub transdermal hormones into your skin. So you rotate, rotate, rotate. Now, one thing I noticed in a lot of the tools that you'll have in the menopause method, they grew organically out of my own experience, like after repeating how to determine your doses to for a couple of years with women. And then also in that same visit, how to and where and plot to apply your hormones. I realised man that's fairly repetition is taking up 20 minutes of every session, I want to automate this. So my very first goal at this was at my with my sister in law. And she did a demonstration video of these. And then the second iteration was as my dear beloved daughter in law. And then this is a actress that we've been invited into follow the scripts we wrote for how to get your hormone dosages right. That's all about dose determination that's all about the cards is the tool for that. And then also how to apply the hormones is the second video. And I definitely suggest that you view these videos. And even try if you're new to this, if you're brand new to this to educate your own patients for a while, and then refer them to the videos because the women are sitting there in an office visit that can last anywhere from an hour to two hours or even longer for some and how much of that do they retain? Well, they've got this resource, because you can embed these videos on your website or you can refer your patients to our website. Or you can make a link on your website to these videos that you're on menopause method website. However it is I think you're going to find these to be a very useful tool. And you won't have to go through the explanation as many times as I went through the explanation, I mean it's always fine. But you know saving the patient 20 minutes saving yourself 20 minutes a good thing
