We're now going to discuss the statement that we are a no breast tenderness method. And you know, bottom line, we know that there's a risk factor. for breast cancer, it has to do with increased breast density fibrocystic, breast disease, unhealthy breasts. And so the good news is we can identify this, and we can address it. And I've been able to successfully address breast tenderness every time. So whatever it takes, this is some a subject that I hold near and dear, because what are we really want to do most of all, in menopause method is we want to reduce the risk for breast cancer as close to zero as we possibly can. And you are going to encounter women that have mammograms that show increased density, that's an increased risk. And there was a time that I was using thermograms. And mammograms is my screening procedure. And as I'm going to explain later, I no longer use thermograms as a breast screening procedure, but I do use thermograms very usefully when there is breast tenderness, a history of fibrocystic breast disease, when a mammogram does show increased density, and what the thermogram reveals is increased heat, if there is inflammation, and that's what we want to address in any woman who has increased breast density does she have inflammation, because that's where the risk is really narrows down to does she have inflammation and unhealthy breasts. I'm gonna give you an example here of a thermogram of one of my patients who was nulliparous, which is a common reason for increased breast density and fibrocystic breast disease. And what we treated this woman with was SSI or you can also use the pill form of the iodine and you can go up as high as 50 milligrammes, which would be equivalent to eight drops of blue balls, but that would be a very unusual situation, we started out for a month or two on the high dosage with this particular patient and then we reduced it to the 12 and a half milligramme dosage, and look at how this inflammation and heat resolved over time, I assert to you that between this tool between advising not to use compression bras, oh my goodness, underwire bras compression bras, and not and actually discouraging use of 24 hour brow wearing or 12 hour or as little brow use as possible, you reduce the incidence of increased breast density and also using di m to address the two to 16 ratio can also be relevant. Now in using these large doses of iodine. Dr. gayby reminds us in an editorial in the Townsend letter first appeared in that editorial that we're playing with very high dosages to do this. And that's okay, but we want to monitor these and not do these forever. And what do you monitor the thyroid? Because I grew up in an era where if a woman had Graves disease and they needed to do a thyroid operation, the surgeons love to come down the circulation of that thyroid gland. And what did they do? They gave the women iodine which quieted that thyroid gland down and it can quiet a healthy thyroid gland down to me if you're using too high doses for too long. So be cautious and review Dr. Gabby's article on this in which he goes into detail. How do you monitor the thyroid is I'm going to mention in the thyroid section. And also, as I mentioned, as part of the initial screening and blood tests for thyroid, I always get a TSH free T for Free T three and reverse T three and every single patient. So any patient that I'm working with, I've had that baseline and if we move into treating with iodine, I can repeat that test and see how their their thyroid is doing. There's some additional information I'd like to bring to you regarding the value of thermography and some of the drawbacks of it. Here's a thermogram of a woman who this is a thermogram taken prior to her ever using the birth control pill. And here is the thermogram after using the birth control pill while she was on it, look at the increased heat is represented by the red zones in the breast and under the breasts. Yes, that breast chest fold is a very common place to get increased heat there. It gives you an idea of one of the things that can go on and the use of the week give women, this birth control pill, increased breast density, don't like to do it. And here's an article promoting thermography. And fair enough it it has some value. But oh, when we get down to some details here, it can have a 27% positive predictive value. I found this to be true. Here's the thermogram on one of my patients, and this was the initial test. Look at those red spots on that breast. Well, these were read as negative but keep your eye on him. And then a follow up thermogram. Three months later, the red spots the heat, the suspicious spots are not there looks like this thermogram. And this patient improved. In an actual reality. This was a false negative. That lump persisted, this patient had a biopsy, the mammogram revealed that it was highly suspicious for cancer. And so this was one of three cases that were in the other cases were similar to this where for me, it was do not use the thermogram as a reliable breast cancer screening technique because I have three in my practice three incidences of false negatives. In one of the cases the patient did the thermogram first was reassured that the thermogram had gone negative decided to postpone the mammogram. And the lump persisted. And the moment when she finally did do the mammogram, she did have a suspicion of cancer and a biopsy proved it to be so. So what am I saying? I can say for certain myself, I will never use the thermogram as a cancer screening technique. And I have had women who've had negative breast exams, whew, the mammogram was positive. And we were able to catch a breast cancer to very small size and prior to metastases. That is such an amazing situation when you detect a cancer, and you are able to do simple surgical techniques prior to metastasis, oh my goodness, it's a marvellous thing. And you're in if you have a woman who has a well differentiated breast cancer that she's been developing over the last 10 to 15 years prior to you're seeing her and you start giving her bioidentical hormones in menopause, if that's well differentiated again. Thus, it has oestrogen receptor sites and progesterone receptor sites that are quite active, you're going to accelerate the growth of that cancer. So this is the world of assessing and protecting against breast cancer and mammogram is a phenomenal tool. And I find thermography very useful, especially when there's increased breast density, but not as something that I will persist. And it's very, that I will use as a primary screening tool for breast cancer. And it's very useful when you're trying to convince a woman who has increased breast density, and she's wearing underwire bras. And you see, she sees visually, the excessive heat that's caused by those underwear or compression bras to dissuade her from using those because a lot of women do like those underwear bras and, you know, from from all that I know, I would say eliminate him entirely for every woman. So thermography can be a very useful tool. And here's an example of a negative thermogram that turned out to have a positive mammogram. And fortunately, we caught this breast cancer early and simple surgical procedures, were able to end follow up with follow up radiation were to be able to treat her successfully. She's now far more than five years out.

I have a wonderful thermography technician here in town. And I was running these cases by her and she does remind us that yes, the detection of cancer is a is a multi tool approach. And the one thing she did want to say is she wanted to remind me that women in her practice, received thermograms and unveiled cancers that the mammograms had not unveiled. So like anything in medicine, there's a lot to it. Anything we take on there's a lot of pros, a lot of cons, use the tools appropriately and use those tools. Here's the statement from the thermographer saying can we deny the cancers that we do detect? And can we deny the other information that we get from thermography that may help one moment avoid cancer because we made suggestions really what this was about was alleviating inflammation in the breasts. So you know, like anything, there's a lot to it. And here's another thermogram I was mentioning what under wire bras look like and take a look at the heat prior to removal underneath that breast and in the axilla and in the ladder will show Post wall and post removal a lot was achieved simply by removing underwire bras. The whole subject of bras is an interesting one. And here's some links. Here's Dr. Mercola has a comment about wearing bras and how the study that shows that women who do not wear bras and cultures have much less of a breast cancer risk. And one of my patients uncovered this bra that has nice support, and at the same time does not do compression. You can give this out to your patients. As they explore changes in the kind of bras that they are using. I like to put another plug in from mammography. When I started out in functional medicine and holistic medicine, I was frightened of X rays, and certainly frightened of mammograms. But over the course of time when I started seeing these mammograms detect cancers that were not palpable and not identifiable on breast exam. It started changing my mind and I had the great privilege in my career, to live in the same town with the most amazing radiologist, I would assert exists ever existed on the planet Earth. Think about this, he was in his 80s in every single x ray that he ever took. He brought the patient into the X ray viewing room and talk to her about her individual X rays. Were viewers Where have you seen that before? This gentleman, this physician was a expert in mammography and without going into the details with you. He convinced me about the importance of mammograms, you don't have to do them every month, that'd be absurd, or every year or every six months. You just find the appropriate frequency repetition with each individual patient. There's women who obviously have very benign breast and are very unlikely to develop anything. You don't have to do those annually. And there's some women that you do because they're suspicious there. Yes, the subject of really, it's about reducing the risk for breast cancer as close to zero as we can possibly achieve that. And there is so much that we can detect and there's so much good that we can do in women that do have increased density and fibrocystic breast disease. We are a no breast tenderness method.
