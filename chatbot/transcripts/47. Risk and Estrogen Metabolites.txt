Now, we're going back to look at that ratio, the two to 16 ratio, we like to see a greater than one, ideally, it's greater than two, that means there's twice as much of the two hydroxy metabolite is there is the 16 Alpha Hydroxy. And here's an article by Dr. Wright on this reducing the risk. And He's declaring that the risk for breast cancer, as far as it relates to hormones goes can derive from insufficient progesterone, or a deficiency of estriol or increased testosterone, the literature is mixed on this, and then a decrease two to 16 ratio. In other words, we can look at these metabolites and assess is there an increased risk, you know, a blood glucose of 150 puts you at an absolute risk for diabetes. In fact, it absolutely gives you diabetes. So that's an example of a laboratory test that is 100% correlates with risk for an illness. A fasting blood glucose of 120 puts you at significant risk for diabetes, and then 110, maybe you're gonna call it pre diabetes, maybe you're gonna call it diabetes. At any rate, sometimes tests are very predictive for a certain outcome, often a adverse outcome. That is not true for the two to 16 ratio. There are correlations, we do this because I consider it to be valuable, and I care about it enough about the scientific literature here to want to get this ratio correct. And we'll get into how you do that. But that literature is there. And interestingly enough, that ratio can also be improved by giving the brassica family of vegetables broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and also extracts from the brassica family, di m. And also indole. Three carbinol can be beneficial to reduce risks, and of course, helping the liver as well because sometimes there's core liver issues, not necessarily liver illness, as in hepatitis, for example, but a decreased liver ability to metabolise various things I know about this. When I was in medical school, I'd like to stay up to all hours of the morning and I would drink a cup of coffee at midnight. And then I drink a cup, a second cup of coffee at 1am, because that first cup of coffee had been burned off, so to speak metabolised by my liver, that caffeine was gone. I needed another coffee an hour later and another coffee cup of coffee an hour after that. Well, my liver will not do that. These days, I wouldn't dream of drinking a cup of coffee. With dinner, I'd stay up for hours is my my rate of metabolising that caffeine is very much slower. I'm not proud to announce and this metabolite issue and went through a phase of being challenged. It was challenged within back and forth articles within the Townsend letter. But you know, when you listen to Dr. Wright's comments about the challenging doctor, it's not hard for me to conclude along with actual right that the preponderance of the evidence from the study of the oestrogen metabolites in tissues and urine support the oestrogen metabolite ratio hypothesis, meaning you want to have a lot more to than you have 16 and that the metabolite ratio can be modulated in a predictable manner through dietary changes in the use of certain nutraceuticals. So as I followed that discussion, I certainly concluded along with the doctor, right, and I, you know, knowing what I know, if a woman's got less, ratio less, two to 16, less two hydroxy. I'm going to do what I can to normalise that. And the here's another article from the breast cancer research literature in the journal and it's talking about the relation of the serum estrogens in the metabolites in postmenopausal breast cancer risk. And what they're concluding is women with more extensive hydroxylation along the two pathway may have a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. So there's other sources of this discussion of this risk. And here's yet another article, in which the conclusions are the development of cancer from the first malignant tumour cell to clinical diagnosis takes many years 10 to 15 years, and hormones can influence tumour growth, but it is questionable whether hormones induce malignant tumours de novo, it's much more likely that hormones merely promote the growth of an already existing tumour cell, which means there are a multitude of causes for breast cancer. And yet, it is unlikely that hormones are the cars and yet if they've got a well differentiated, breast cancer breast gland or cancer that has oestrogen receptor sites in it, just like the parent normal cell does you can influence the growth by giving estrogens. Just want to keep reminding us about that? Because the question in so many women's minds is our hormones causing cancer. And this is one of the issues that comes down to. So you can talk about the two to 16 ratio all day, or it could talk about treating women in menopause with bioidentical hormones, including estrogens. And what the risk comes down to are the risks for cancers in general, which are multifactorial and causes. And it's doubtful that the hormones do anything other than promote the growth if there is a well differentiated oestrogen positive receptor site breast cancer
