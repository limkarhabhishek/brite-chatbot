And it consists of that questionnaire, and the 24 hour urine hormone tests and the blood tests and possible mammogram, breast thermogram bone mineral density, trans vaginal ultrasound. And what I left out of that was the gin exam. Absolutely. And then again, this was specified in the original agreements that the patient signed in what you do prior to that consultation is you email this patient a link to the annual questionnaire, and you also have her access and get to you recent blood tests. Most of the patients I see also have their own family physicians or you hit you specify the blood tests that you want to see and Senator the requisitions. So you get prior to this annual consultation, you get her requisitions for the blood test, you get her 24 hour urine hormone test kits shipped to her or have her pick it up at the office, and then by you or by her family doc or her gynaecologist, she's getting an annual pelvic exam, manual breast exam, this is the full female exam. And then if she's not getting the female exam from you, the pelvic exam from you somehow by hook or by crook, I'm hoping I can get the patient to ask her examiner on a scale of one to 1010 being the most, the amount of vaginal health compared to a 25 year old. I find that of all the examinations that I do that I'm not getting the information on in that I used to do when I would do my own pelvic exams, is I really liked to see that vaginal health because remember, I told you that if she's got decent vaginal health, it's high likelihood that she's been cruising on some decent hormone levels there. That oestrogen is gonna drop certainly be all sex and a lot between six and eight micrograms per 24 hours total potent estrogens to have a compromise that vaginal health. So I learned so much from the vaginal exam. So I at least wanted to I try and impart this. We've tried many different techniques. We've given the patient's cards, but it's a year later. But we try and ask them to ask their their examiner. Give me an give me a comment on the amount of vaginal health I have compared to when you would have would you expect it when I was 25 years old? Oh, my God, I had the first wonderful come in from a patient of mine recently. She said my gynaecologist said, tell him this, he'll know what I mean. Healthy ru gay. When finally after all these years, I got the impeccable response. That's always what I've been looking for. And she, verbatim she told me that and I went, he was so right. It's the exact language that I wanted to know. And then I asked a second question, if they can remember, for them to estimate the amount of vaginal atrophy on a scale of one to 10. And of course, you're gonna learn just for the questionnaire? Do they have been on your course? Do they need lubrication? Do they have a current bladder infections, you're gonna learn about vaginal health? They still having intercourse. But this is the very best when the female examiner will actually comment to the patient and she can she communicates that comment to you. But how does the health of my vagina compared to when I was 25 years old? If you had to make a guess? On a scale of one to 10? Would you give me a 10? And nine and eight? Or how much vaginal atrophy is you say that a lot of it? Is there a 10 of vaginal atrophy? And nine or eight? Or is it a four of that vaginal atrophy. They can remember this. It's a great thing. And some do. And then there's the imaging. I keep up with the imaging, I've already explained to you that blessed be the allies that I have. We've picked up on breast cancers early because we're paying attention to it. And we also use thermography as a tool to uncover underlying breast inflammation because we're a no breast inflammation practice. And there's things that you can do that are not hard to do that can get rid of the underwire bras, you treat them with iodine if need be. And of course, there's more things that you can do as well, in the thermography is principally to detect inflammation. There's not a screening test. And I know I'm repeating myself, but I want these to be emblazoned in the least your thought patterns of how you address and then the bone mineral density. I mean, the rate of getting repeat bone mineral density is gonna vary enormously. You have someone who doesn't have any osteopenia, you're not gonna have to repeat that every year, especially when you're instituting hormones, my goodness. And then there's others who you're dealing with very substantial osteoporosis and you're going to want to do this imaging at the rate that you need to certainly not more frequently than every year and then the transvaginal ultrasound. It's bailed me out and is one of our physicians pointed out that To who's a pathologist, originally, she said you don't the yields not very high on this. And so you could do a lot get a lot of normals before you're going to pick up something and bleeding usually reveals the endometrial cancer. And you know what she's right. My yield on transvaginal ultrasounds because there was a time, I insisted that every patient get one annually. Now I don't. But you'll know you'll get some clues. And then I do get them periodically, I want to see because if you get a thick endometrial stripe, it's from your hormone treatment, and could be from inadequate progesterone could be from excessive oestrogen. And you at least want to learn that that stripe has no irregularities in it. And then that's going to help you modify the dosage for the individual that you're actually dealing with. So I definitely have not given up on transvaginal ultrasound. And then the annual consultation wrap up is you review all the information that you've acquired, and there could be dosage adjustments, as well as other measures that you want to take. And very often, the patient's gonna stay on the same dose, the same formulation. And they'll do that for years. And sometimes you'll have to tweak because you've seen the 24 hour urine hormone results. They might be developing mild trans dermal fatigue in what you want to increase in dosages and make sure that they're rotating. And these are the kinds of things that can be little tweaks that can make a big difference you find a patient never rotates, you find a patient is applying more than one hormone to the same spot even though you've instructed and even though those videos, instruct them not to do that. And so there's, there's often little tiny tune ups you can be here you're gonna find women on the annual consultation that never conformed to the stop the hormones once a month. And you know, it's a lot that they take in in that first initial three months. And these are the common dropouts, you're gonna see some libido decline. And there's some things you can do about that. So that annual visit is usually a productive visit. It's very unusual that we change nothing. And so the annual visit great thing
