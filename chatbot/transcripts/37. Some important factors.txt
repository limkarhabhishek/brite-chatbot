I now like to work with a concept called right dose. And I'm going to define it a lot more specifically than I have up till now.



00:14

Well, and the dose determination schedule, we said that the bias maximum should be three and three before you test.



00:22

And I have actually specified the starting dose of one drop, the ID for a total of nine tenths of milligramme rested Allah coulomb per day, and then we leave the option for the give the option there for a pump to a maximum dose of three drops big Well, when you do the math, that's a total of 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. And let's say that a woman has now come to your office for a second consultation.



00:50

And she's had four weeks of dose determination and symptom alleviation. And according to what I had to say, in the beginning, we're coming back to where I initially began, this whole presentation is 18% could actually test above the optimal Test Range, even though they titrated to three and 350 7% could actually test below the optimal test range. So I'm wanting to deal with what I brought up initially, like, how do we get this right? Because we want to get those dosages in the green zone, the optimal dose is rolling in and we don't want to go over the top or go too low. And we certainly don't want to go way over the top or way too low. And I don't want to over dramatise what can happen there, there's been a lot of women that have been overdose with plenty of hormones, and there was no observable consequence. But again, in the spirit of keeping the risk as close to zero as we can possibly get it, we want to do everything is exactly as we can. The purpose of the checklists. Remember the pilots,



01:53

they need checklists. And they are very important. So the optimal dose treatment dosages dosage is sufficient to alleviate symptoms. Absolutely. And even most important to prevent or reverse muscle loss, bone loss, vaginal atrophy, cognitive decline, arterial degeneration, not even I haven't even listed all of our goals here. And to support the energy of patients general energy, their mood, their sleep and their libido. This is what we're after. This is the big wonderful is right there. We want to keep Google walking, talking, thinking and having healthy bladders skin hair and plus plus plus, doesn't that sound like a great thing. And at the same time, we want minimal enough hormones for no breast glandular proliferation. And we want no excessive and a major proliferation.



02:50

Right there. This is our principal goals for treating women in menopause. This is the whole intention, and hopefully execution



03:04

of how we're approaching treating women in menopause with bioidentical hormones. Well, I want to give you a comparison of all the possibilities that the spectrum of possibilities that can occur and treatment. For example, at one end of the spectrum, there could be women who received no treatment at all, or there could be a certain number of women who get what we would call minimum treatment, or moderate treatment or even robust treatment. And you can even go beyond robust into super physiologic hormone levels higher than women are customarily having and very exquisite testing. And you can even give enough hormone to get the menses to continue or to return a little man does that take a lot to do that. And here's where we're working. Now, without yet specifying it, the recommended treatment range is going to be in the minimum to moderate area because that's all it takes. It doesn't take much. It doesn't take robust levels of oestrogen to keep a woman healthy, that's for sure. And at the no treatment end of the spectrum, like I mentioned previously, there's going to be a certain number of patients that they come to the office for the first visit, they've agreed to all the agreements are reviewed their questionnaire, and then it comes time for me to start looking at the subject of risk and trying to get an assessment of how they feeling about risk. And I'm starting to sense that they are concerned. And they obviously have implanted thoughts that if they're going to use these hormones, they are putting themselves at risk for breast cancer, among other things. And I love to flush this out in the open and I do not try and sway a woman one way or another. It is never my objective in that first consultation to make sure that a woman walks out the door with hormones. My objective is to try and assess what is the optimal thing for the woman and make right choices around that. Now it turns out, there's only been one or two occasions in the whole course, that my decades of practice with women in menopause that I've ever



05:00

We've said this, you know, we've discussed the risks and benefits in.



05:06

We've been, here's what I'm thinking that there's still a concern in you about whether to use these hormones or not. And why don't we respect that? Why don't we postpone or never have you take hormones? You know, most of the women on earth throughout history have not taking hormones. It's not like there's no consequence of that, as I have mentioned that. But you know, there is no law or rule that says it's imperative to take hormones. Why don't we respect your reluctance, and we don't have to, there's no emergency here. We don't have to do anything. So one thing I suggest is we just respect it, and we call it a day. And you'll discover what's appropriate for you, and what's most beneficial for you over time. And that's what we're looking for. And one thing I can recommend is that you learn a bunch more about it, because one thing that happened to me around the whole subject of risk and benefit is I dived into all the beautiful research that is done in this area. And when I came out the other side of my initial foray, I've been many forays into the literature. I went got I get it, it's no longer this mystery to me. It's, these are this is what we discover. And once you have the reassurance, you're going to better be able to determine what's the right thing to do for you. So I am lingering on that in talking about the comparison of treatment and the spectrum of all possibilities. Because there's some women that we want to honour their risk and fears for all you know, that woman, although the whole idea appeals to her, and she'd love to alleviate her symptoms, that somewhere in her consciousness that she's not necessarily aware of she knows she's harbouring a breast cancer, and the hormones are not going to cause the breast cancer. But they're if there's positive receptor sites, if this is a well differentiated cancer, they are those hormones are going to facilitate the growth most likely of the proliferation of that cancer. Now, the real issue is they proliferate to make it easier to identify, or do they proliferate, and we run the risk of metastasis during that proliferation? Because that's what we don't want is that metastasis. We don't want the cancer proliferation of it, but we really don't want the metastases. So this is something that I have not figured out, nor do I know that our scientific community has figured out about whether we're not only facilitating the proliferation of the individual tumour, but we're also facilitating metastases. It's that timing of that metastases. Well, obviously, the longer the cancer grows, the greater the risk of metastatic disease. But at any rate, we don't know if this woman's intuition is somehow saying, Yeah, hormone sound great for everybody else. But my intuition says no. So again,



07:52

I don't like to override anybody. But it's not like I haven't done it in my life. But I sure don't like the results of it. And I don't like to override myself. And I certainly don't like to override patients and try and convince them to do something that they themselves don't feel comfortable doing. So it's fun, to grant freedom and to respect exactly what's going on for any individual. And believe you me, they will find their way back to you over time. If they do for one reason or another, including they might have learned a lot more about hormones. I recommend my book on menopause because we have a chapter on risk. And we have a lot of references to what I call the pristine



08:33

scientific literature references relating to risk. And so they can learn a lot from my book, they can learn a lot from a lot of resources, including siniora Google,



08:46

it's harder to sort out the stuff that pops up on the internet, but at any rate,



08:51

yeah. And once they learn a lot, and they and sometimes if they're beleaguered by symptoms that they weren't terribly troubled



09:01

with by before that time. That's another way they'll find their way back to your office and all of a sudden the risk benefits will look different when they're not sleeping any nights and they get this cannot be healthy.
