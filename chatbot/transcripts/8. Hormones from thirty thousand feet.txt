I'd like to review some basic information about ovarian hormones. You might be familiar with this. The menstrual cycle is seen from the vantage point of our pituitary gland and our ovaries and hormone output and the endometrial lining. And we're going to focus in on the fluctuations of the hormones through a young woman's menstrual cycle. And of course, this is pituitary driven. And a very significant thing is the production of progesterone from the corpus luteum. What that means is if a woman ovulates, she produces a lot of progesterone, if she does not ovulate, she does not form a corpus luteum and does not produce significant amount of progesterone small amount, actually. So looking at two of the hormones through the cycle, in a young menstruating woman. We have the oestrogen curve, a familiar one and the progesterone curve. And notice on that progesterone curve, that it starts to rise to significant amounts mid cycle with ovulation. If there's ovulation, now, we always see it presented like this. And of course, there's the follicular phase, the mid cycle phase and the luteal phase. That's that last part of the cycle. When you're going to test by the way, a young menstruating woman she must be regular, and this is when we want to test her when there's a simultaneous peak of both oestrogen and progesterone. Now we're used to seeing the graph is I've shown it to you, but this is how it looks actually because the progesterone output is so much more substantial than the oestrogen output. For example, at this point in mid luteum. There's 0.33 milligrammes of estradiol per day, and 37 milligrammes 100 times more progesterone, a woman's body really loves progesterone. And this, of course, is reflected in the serum levels. She got to know how these are named, whether it's pica grammes, or nanograms, so I equalised it there. And that's how it appears in the serum, not necessarily on your test. And then I want to look at some variations of hormonal balance possibilities in young woman. And this has been represented as the normal range for the particular hormone we're talking about. It's not a quantity issue. It's a balance issue. And so this is an example of a young cycling woman who's got an average amount of estrogens and also an average amount of progesterone and she's balanced. She's mid range for both. And then here we have a young and cycling woman who has relatively more oestrogen than she does progesterone. And you might see this reflected in her body type. With more oestrogen, a woman tends to be curvier and shorter in stature, because the growth plates are encouraged to close earlier by substantial amounts of oestrogen and she might have larger breasts from stimulation of the breast glandular tissue. And if she's going to have issues with abundance of oestrogen or over abundance of it, she could have PMS, cramps, heavy periods, etc. From the overstimulation of the uterus and the breast from excessive amounts of oestrogen relatively speaking, here's a different balance presented here, where you have relatively less oestrogen compared with the amount of progesterone. And this is going to be reflected in body type or can be these things aren't perfect, but often, these women will be taller, thinner, straighter with smaller breasts. And if they're going to have difficulty, they're going to lean towards having scant periods and very easy ministration. And then we want to bring in testosterone here. So here's an example where the testosterone is more abundant than in the other women and that instead of being mid range, and you'll see this reflected in body type two, these women will tend to be more muscular, more athletic. And then looking at another way to look at these hormones is we see how the hormones vary through as a woman ages. Well, of course when she's a child are very low. But starting an adolescence that oestrogen is really starting to peak, and it peaks out somewhere in the late teens, early 20s. And then it gradually declines over time. And menopause occurs at a certain point when the oestrogen gets so insufficient, that there's no longer the formation of an endometrial lining, which is what oestrogen is partially responsible for. And oestrogen is not the only hormone that behaves like this. In a woman. If we follow the curves of the output of DHEA. It follows a very similar pattern. And then it also follows a similar pattern to how it is in men with testosterone and DHEA. You know, hormone levels decline as people age, that doesn't necessarily mean that's a natural process. We're going to look into more why they decline it because it's more than just this thing called ageing. And then there's a variation Woman to Woman and how these hormones behave over time, here would be one example of how the hormones peak in the early 20s. And gradually decline as a woman gets older, here would be another way that they could decline, they could decline earlier and cascade lower. And here's a mid range for that. I mean, there's infinite possibilities. Here's a woman who didn't quite peak as high. And she gradually declined over time. There's many ways that this can happen for women. The main thing I want to point out is there's variation Woman to Woman, you're gonna see that everywhere in the story of menopause and hormones. I want to show you one progesterone possibility that between the ages of 35 and 50, the estrogens behave like this, they start declining very significantly, they'll decline about 35%. At that point, that we're looking at 35 to 50, whereas the progesterone can decline earlier. And more profoundly, that leads to what and imbalance you got relatively higher oestrogen than compared to the amount of progesterone and we're producing a situation called oestrogen dominance. Because there's more oestrogen, you're getting the effects of oestrogen prevailing over the balancing effects of the progesterone. This comes this particular graph comes courtesy of Dr. Michael lamb. Now, whenever I show you this emblem, what I'm wanting to point out is that this is special information. And you could go cruise through the whole presentation and pick out where these emblems are. And you'll get the soundbite version of some of the most significant things you need to know when you're treating women in menopause. So this point in information, I'm giving the emblem and seal of approval to this particular slide, which is so significant in the world of young women. As far as estrogens go, what did they do? They primarily stimulate they animate, they can even double up and help with the stress response. And they stimulate, for example, more specifically breast glandular tissue and the uterine lining to actually produce a uterine lining so that a woman can men straight. Progesterone, on the other hand, is the great Colmar. For example, if I were to inject progesterone intravenous into myself or anybody and I got the dose, right, it could put us to sleep so deep surgery can be performed on us. Progesterone is the great calmer and you can think of any other hormones or chemicals that do that, except some neurotransmitters such as melatonin and GABA, for example, as far as the hormones go, progesterone is the big calmer, the rest of them are animators. Progesterone is so important to balance the stimulatory effects of the oestrogen less progesterone, more predominance of the oestrogen effects
