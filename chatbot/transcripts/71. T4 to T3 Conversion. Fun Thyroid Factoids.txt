Let's talk about the conversion of T four to T three, because the really active part of what goes on inside of a cell, whereas the end organ for the steroid hormones to actually do what they do the end, the end thyroid hormone is T three, that's the most active within a cell. And so there is a point at which intracellular where T four is converted to T three. And then there is a phenomena and Dr. Wilson wrote about this extensively, you may have heard of it, the Wilson syndrome, where that conversion of t 43, that final conversion is not taking place very well. And I've heard estimates that 10% of the human population don't do that conversion that well. And so I'm bringing this up, because you may have already been very cognizant of this. But it's something we want to pay attention to. Because that you can, that conversion can be compromised by inflammation by elevated cortisol. And then you can see a normal TSH and T four, but the T three is going to be low, because not enough is going on the T four is getting converted to T three. So there's some fun factoids and some intricacy in dealing with the thyroid hormones as well. And just for an overview, 80% of thyroid hormones produced is T four, that's the major output of the thyroid gland is T four 20% of the output is T three. And that is the more potent form. And the bulk of that 80% of the T three in your body is produced by the conversion of the T four into the T three in the cells of the body, such as liver, kidneys, and muscles. intracellular is where that conversion takes place. 0.04% of the T four and 0.4% of the T three is actually active, and free. Yeah, the rest of it's bound. Because you can't float these things around the body is little fat bubbles, who's what these hormones would be in the blood, you got to bind them up. So there's a small percentage that are free and inactive. And here's an example of a 60 year old white female. And this is an actual copy of a segment of her laboratory blood test. And what her T for is micrograms per deciliter is 9.1. And the reference range is between 4.5 and 12. And what her T three is, well, the T three is present in sub much less quantity that you've got to go from micrograms to talk about T three is in nanograms per deciliter. And there's a reference range for nanograms. And then if we convert, micrograms per deciliter to nanograms that T four becomes 9100. So look how much more T four than there than T three that there was. And so 98.7% of it was actually T four in the blood. And then as far as free T four goes, we're down to a small percentage of the total T four. And so this woman had his result one point once seven nanograms per deciliter, and there's the reference range, so she's sitting pretty there. And the free T three we gotta go to further a different units because they're so less free T three. And so the reference range for that is pica grammes per millilitre. If we convert the free Tea for Two pica grammes, we see there's about three times as much free tea for is there as d3 Well, 80%. In, you know, general overview is three, D four, and 20% is free T three, as far as the activity goes, there's the low percentages. So again, dealing with the percentages that is actually free inactive. And now let's look at the free T four. And this woman is within the reference range with 1.17 micrograms per deciliter, deciliter, and mid reference range is 1.30. So where is she in relationship to the mid reference range? Pretty good. I mean, just ballparking it that 1.1 sevens got to be sitting somewhere near them in the middle. How about her free teeth three where she's sitting in with respect to the mid reference range at 3.0 pica grammes per millilitre? Well, there's the range. The mid reference range is 3.2. So she's just slightly below the mid reference range. As far as how far off the mid reference range is, this woman is point four micrograms off of micro grammes per deciliter, and this woman is point two off of the pica grammes. So this woman is sitting fairly pretty there and as far as free T four and three T three goes and with reference to Dr. Friedman, T three has a shorter Half Life and T four is more information about it. In the T four remains in the body a lot longer than T three which has clinical consequences treatment consequences. So compounding pharmacists have realised this, and they'll prepare an extended release, otherwise known as a long acting T three. And this is a very common prescription. We do it all the time. Now there is a, quote, natural combination of T four and T three, the pigs, for example, have a higher amount relatively speaking of T three than humans, and they have the mixture of T four and T three, they just have a greater prevalence of T three. And this is going to be considered when you if you ever use desiccated thyroid preparations, as many do, just to look at some of the just unbelievably fine details of what's going on, you've got t four in the blood, and it gets transported into the cell very easily because it's lipid soluble in this cell membranes are lipids, and you get that t four into the blood, you also have circulating T three that also can make its way into the cell. And there's the conversion, I'm talking about the intracellular T for converting to C three, that's a very important thing. If that doesn't take place, you're gonna get into a hypothyroidism. So that's why I'm putting the emphasis on that little conversion right there. And then it's the T three that enters the nucleus and interacts with the DNA and bad results. Oh my god interaction with DNA and producing protein byproducts. And let's talk about more about the thyroid basics that are basically lipid soluble, and so they pass through the membranes easily. And there's a reference that I'm referring to with these particular statements. The T three binds to specific nuclear receptor proteins with an affinity that is tenfold greater than the affinity for T four. Yep, T three is the operating molecule primarily. And the information of the T three alters DNA transcription into Mr. N A. And the information is eventually translated into many effector proteins. Holy moly, who designed this whole thing?
