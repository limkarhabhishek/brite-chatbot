Now, let's zero in on the 24 hour urine hormone test and look at the analytes and the mathematical derivatives and look at the estrogens. And here are the three parent hormones. estradiol is thrown in estriol. And then there are the metabolites, the two hydroxy, es drone, the two methoxy, es drone, the 16, alpha hydroxy, es drone, and the four hydroxy Astro. Now, many labs also report the four methoxy. But we have an a slightly abbreviated form with less analytes for newcomers to the world of hormone testing, in which I've selected out and worked in concert with a laboratory to produce a result that's much easier to interpret. And and I say, 99% of the time, it's all the analyte, you need to do a great job. And I've left out the form of facce, because four hydroxy is present in such low amounts, that there's a question about the reliability of the form of facce. Then there's the mathematical derivatives of the parent hormones in the metabolites. And I've already spoken about them. There's the total potent estrogens which is the sum of estradiol and estrone, e two plus e one, there's the oestrogen quotient, and sometimes known as the oestrogen ratio, and that's estriol in the numerator over the total potent estrogens in the denominator. The denominator is the sum of E two plus e one, and then there's the two to 16 ratio, and then it's the first the parent hormone might be progesterone. But the way we assess it is analysing the amount of pregnant dial in the urine because progesterone is so efficiently metabolised to pregnant dial in the body that you're not going to see new progesterone itself in the urine as the parent hormone of the androgens or DHEA, and testosterone, the metabolites, the principal metabolites, and there's many metabolites, but the principal ones, the ones that are present in the most abundant numbers is eto collana alone and Andrus, Rouen. And although both DHEA and testosterone convert to eto klant alone and Anders thrown pretty often you'll see a tendency of that IDI Atlantic loan to rise and fall with the DHEA levels primarily. And then there's corticosteroids and apparent hormone is cortisol and cortisone. And the metabolites are th, E, th, F, and five Alpha th, if there are additional minor metabolites, I don't find them useful clinically. So in suggesting to the laboratory director on how to simplify these results, in a way there is still 1,000,000% Clinical useful, these are the principal corticosteroid metabolites that we have chosen. And then I always like to look at the some of the three principal corticosteroid metabolites, because in order to understand are any family of hormones, you want to know the parent hormone, like the cortisol could be high, or reasonable and normal, but the three metabolites th e plus th, f plus five, alpha DHF, could be low. What's going on there, the body is trying to preserve is much of the form of the hormone and the parent hormone, because there's probably a depletion going on. Or in the case of estrogens, for example, you could see something that's different than that you could see the estradiol and a stone being low, but the metabolites being high, and that is the situation that takes place. In order to really understand the estrogens, you've got to see both the hormones and metabolites. And in the case I just described there, a woman who has been on Premarin for many years, very often will have a ramped up liver metabolism of oestrogen because if there was an excessive dose lib was trying to get rid of it. And that ramping up does not necessarily decline when you go into bioidentical hormones. So you can see a lot more metabolites and you do parent hormones, different variations can occur. The bottom line is, in order to understand each of these families of hormones excellently. You want both the parent hormone and the metabolites. Now, I want to show you an example of how these appear on test results because they're ordered this way, with the parent hormones, the metabolites of the estrogens and also the math ratios. And then the pregnancy dial, and then the DHEA and testosterone with eto collana alone and Andrus terone, and then the corticosteroids and its metabolites, and the sum of THC. So this is one way that these appear on test results. And this is actually the simplification I've done. Laboratories also produce more elaborate results, you're free to get either one. Those of you are at the beginning of your training, I'd say you're gonna get 99% of all the information you need, just from this series of analyte. So I recommend the simple rendition. There's the oestrogen and metabolites progesterone metabolite progesterone doesn't show up in the urine again, the androgens and its metabolites and the corticosteroid and its metabolites. And my God, what a bargain. This is $159 to 350. I'm repeating myself but you look for a better bargain in medicine, especially as you start to realise the value of these this is an example of that simplified report. It's all on one page. It's broken down to the hormone family the estrogens progesterone which is pregnant and dial, the androgens in the corticosteroids, the metabolites are represented in this as well. And one modification that I've asked for is instead of doing age related reference ranges I wanted compared and it's pointed out on this page, that the reference ranges we're comparing it, too, is a 20 to 29 year old. Why do that? Well, what's the value, if you've got a 65 year old woman to showing the the testing results of the age bracket of 60 to 69 year olds, what you're gonna see is almost, you're gonna see very, very low hormone levels, yet, we're trying to move hormone treatment into reasonable ranges, I am not suggesting that you try and replenish hormone levels to what they were when a woman was between 20 and 29. But I want to get you something real and useful to compare it to. So you can fall in the lower shins in the 20 to 29 year old range, that's for sure. And you can see also, when you go higher than a woman between 20 and 29 year old, the longer you stay in this field, you're liable to conclude, if you want reference ranges to compare things to you might as well compare it to young women. And then make adjustments in your own mind. Because you don't need to replicate youthful levels, right testing 24 hour urine hormone testing, I think you've probably heard me say that and know that I stand strongly on that one. Again, here's the test results. And what I want to point out here is that I want to focus in on the estrogens learn more about this family. And you will find me repeating things, but a lot because I want to help you get through the hump if you haven't been doing 24 Are your hormone tests of understanding the analytes and the mathematical derivatives and know how to use them, and you get exposed to enough test results? You'll get it? What does it take 510 test results you're already getting, I get what this is about. And you can of course have help and interpreting those initial test results or any test results. Well, the three hormones are extra dial. That's the most potent one. Remember that s drone is about 80% as potent as estradiol and estriol. These are the three parent hormones, and estriol is about an eighth as potent as the Astra dial. And then there's four metabolites. There's the two hydroxy Estro, and the two methoxy s drone, there 16 Alpha Hydroxy testerone. And the four hydroxy is shown again, there's more metabolites, but I assert that all you need to get the great work done is the ones that I'm listing here. And then there's the mathematical derivative. So we add up the potent estrogens, estradiol plus e one, there's the oestrogen quotient, are known in some laboratories as the oestrogen ratio. And then there's the two to 16 ratio when you're working with the metabolites, those in the mathematical derivatives, just to keep zeroing in on this subject, because I think it certainly took me a while before I was able to grok what's going on here, so you're going to hear some repetition in here. But if you take the extra dial in the Yes, drone. The sum of those two is the total potent estrogens. They are the potent estrogens. Now the math is not perfect, because as drones only 80% of estradiol. So what is the sum worth? Well, once you get yourself used to summing these up, there is a reference range and you will find this extremely valuable piece of information. Why? Because bottom line and menopause minutes and we don't want the total potent estrogens to be too high. And we don't want the total potent estrogens to be too low. We actually want them between the goalposts of eight and 14 micrograms per 24 hours. On occasion, we will accept higher numbers. And we have criteria for when we will accept those those are the total potent estrogens, they are your friend. They certainly are my friend to understand what's going on in my patient. I mean, when you do go through all this information and practice around treating women and menopause and getting your total potent estrogens, right is one of the most important things I think you can possibly do. You certainly don't want too little. Then you put a woman at risk for all it's not at risk. It's highly likely she's gonna get vaginal atrophy, osteopenia, osteoporosis sarcopenia as it relates to the other hormones, the androgens involved. You don't want her to be too low.

And you don't want her to be too high. Now let's look how these relate to the oestrogen ratio or the oestrogen quotients. If II three is in the numerator and the total potent estrogens in the denominator, we want to see that number somewhere between two and four. I will accept that greater than four. And I have special criteria for that. I promise to review that with you as well. And then there's the two to 16 ratio. Am I repeating myself? Yeah, I am because I want you to get real familiar with these and these are these are homeboys here are home girls. Are these these are the, these are the basics of understanding a 24 hour urine hormone test seemed like a lot of information. When I first looked at that list of analytes, it was totally daunting to me like, Oh my God. And as I heard recently, where the practitioner that I was consulting with, she said, I didn't do the 24 hour urine Rama tests, I took one look at that list of analytes. And I said, I don't have time to learn that. Well. Hopefully, I encouraged her to extend her learning process into something that was the bottom line of treating women safely and menopause. And then there's the methylation. And we'd like to see the right amount of methylation. I mean, that is ultimately what a healthy liver is called upon to do. And we don't want to see too much for hydroxy and it's very rare that you will form methoxy estrone is measurable in the labs are measuring them, I just left it out of our basic profile, because there's so little of it, unless there's a lot of four hydroxy and then you wonder why is there a lot of four hydroxy if there's not a lot of four hydroxy you're gonna there's a small amount of where I drive, so you're, you're gonna have a challenging analyte to to interpret, because if there's so little for hydroxy, how much can you rely on the form of facce I've been told that it gets unreliable, as the levels get really down low. Now, there's other things possible, and there's labs that are doing some wonderful work. All the labs are measuring the form of facce. And they're also measuring the two methoxy Astra dial because this can relate to risk factor or benefit factor if you're if you're treating with two methoxy and then aldosterone can be measured oxytocin, human growth hormone melatonin, thyroid, these can all be measured Meister away from thyroid because it's only the T three and it's variable and I so I have definitely use serum thyroid hormone levels in analytes to for thyroid interpretation, and then there's always you about whether the insurance company's gonna pay for this and the payment options are but I want to tell you about all aspects including payment does make a difference of course
