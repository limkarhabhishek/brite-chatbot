And what is this, the thyroid hormone doing? It was decades into working with thyroid, or I learned what it actually was doing and it's stimulation of cellular constituents by T three right down into the mitochondria into the myosin ATPase of the muscles. It's affecting the sodium potassium pump. Wow, how basic is this mitochondria? The myosin ATPase and the muscles, the sodium potassium pump. My god thyroid hormone is really, it really is connecting up with some of the most fundamental, physiologic and biochemical processes we've got going on. That's why hypothyroidism is very impactful. It's influencing the adrenergic beta receptors. And there's many enzyme systems and proteins for growth and maturation, that including the CNS, that is related to thyroid hormone. I mean, hypothyroidism in young people, in infants and children, it stunts the growth, big problems. What are these thyroid hormones actually doing? They're stimulating oxygen consumption in almost all cells. Stimulating oxygen consumption, oxidative metabolism, holy moly. This is interceding on a very deep core, fundamental level affecting DNA and RNA. oxidative metabolism, my goodness, and thus thyroid hormones stimulate the rate of hepatic glucose output and peripheral glucose utilisation in the paddock metabolism of fatty acids and cholesterol and triglycerides. And that in synthesis of many important proteins in the sodium potassium pump, the respiratory systems Erythropoietin, the Agile beta adrenergic receptors, the sex hormones, growth factors, etc. And the absorption of carbohydrates in the intestine and the gut excretion of cholesterol. Yeah. When I was under the mentorship of Dr. Matt Ivanovic, he said to me, one day, I can picture him, we're in the clinic, and he's saying, you know, you can learn everything you need to know, by the proper history and examination of the patient. And my goodness, they were very adamant about that at the University of Michigan. And even the thyroid blood testing we're doing in those days, you don't even see these things around anymore protein, Mt. Iodine and such was how we were evaluating things we don't even we didn't even know what the TSH was we weren't measuring the TSH, back. But document of and it says, You don't need any blood tests. You'll learn everything from the history and physical that you need to know. As far as the thyroid, of course, they were very detailed about that. And he said, but if you want to go modern and check a blood test, check their cholesterol. If that cholesterol is elevated, there's a good chance it's because they don't have enough thyroid hormone. And that's why I lingered on the gut excretion of cholesterol thyroid modulates that modulates reproductive function. And there are many rates simulating effects are summarised and an overall increase in oxygen consumption, thus, basal metabolic rate and that's one of the ways we used to assess this slow but long lasting chlorogenic and thermogenic effect is confined to the mitochondria. Oh my god, thyroid hormones and the catecholamines work together and metabolic acceleration. So you've got a couple of possibilities there, you got that slow hum of the basal metabolic rate, and then you can accelerate it in conjunction with the catecholamines for fight or flight or increased activity demands. Thyroid hormones, of course, increased cardiac rate and output as well as ventilation pulmonary ventilation. Yeah, this is one way we assess clinically whether you've overdosed someone on thyroid, their pulse rate increases, so we're always gonna base on pulse. And, among other things, and the high basal metabolic rate raises the core and shell temperature, so that the peripheral vessels dilate and this basal debilitation forces the cardiac output to increase and thyroid hormone has some permissive effects in permissiveness in biology is a biochemical phenomena in which the presence of one hormone is required in order to get another hormone to exert its full of facts and a target cell. Amen. In it seems like a theory, but this is what I was saying. In order to get thyroid balance, you've got to get cortisol balanced and vice versa, or more technically, thyroid hormone increases the number of receptors available for epinephrine. Look at that. One hormone is increasing the number of receptors available to another hormone. And we've already seen that the presence the presence of the progesterone surge at midcycle increases the sensitivity of the ester Region receptor sites to oestrogen. Who can understand the exquisite detail of how this is all set up. So adequate thyroid hormone is needed for adequate epinephrine effect on a target cell. And epinephrine would only have a weak effect. Without thyroid hormone. Cortisol exists a permissive effect on growth hormone. This is not the only place that these permissive effects take place.
