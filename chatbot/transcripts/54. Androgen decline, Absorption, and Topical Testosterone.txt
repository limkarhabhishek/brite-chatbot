DHEA is approximately 25% of youth levels by perimenopause or less. It turns out that these androgens can double function in to support the biological fight or flight response and they do. And my goodness, it's not common for me to see a woman entering the perimenopause that has 25% Or for youthful DHEA uncommon, and I see them occasionally, but not commonly, they're usually less than 25% of useful levels, but sooner or later androgen decline is going to occur. And again, it might be adequate in the perimenopause. As a very an oestrogen disappears, sex hormone binding globulin can diminish, leading to an increase of free testosterone and the quality of that some of which are beneficial, but substantial declines often occur later or sooner they're gonna decline. And adrenal androgens will deplete with significant stress, that means they can decline earlier rather than later. And one thing about the practical aspects of dealing with a woman in perimenopause, early menopause is most of the time, you're not going to have to deal with the antigens right away. And I think it's convenient not to, I think it's great to send a woman out the door with a prescription for biassed and progesterone. And let her get used to that because it's great when a woman gets a feel for these hormones and that balance all on their own. And then eventually you're going to be testing are usually at the three month mark. And you'll get a real precise read on the androgens that time. And that's a good time to introduce them. Because a woman has now had two to three months of experience with dose determination and getting an internal feel, which I think there's no substitute for, for the estrogens and the progesterone. Because talking about adjusting dosage is when a woman feels it herself. Boy there you got the best person in the room to be messing with her ups and downs of hormone levels. Now, there is an exception to this. There are some women on the first visit where they're showing me their triceps, there's a lot of flab there and they're pointing out that there used to be muscle there. I do the this test that I find almost infallible where they're sitting in a chair in my office. And I say please stand up without using your arms to assist yourself on the armrests. And you'll learn so much about the strength of their quadriceps their lower extremity muscles, and whether they're sarcopenia. From that just from that. And of course, if you're doing your own physical exams, you'll see sarcopenia it can be pretty obvious in many cases, and not all cases because sometimes fat can replace the muscles. But at any rate, that stand up test out of a chair without assistance is going to tell you a lot and or you can even ask the women, how easy is it for you when you're sitting on the floor to stand up? And they'll tell you because they noticed the difference, that it's a lot harder than when they were in their 20s, for example. So if there's obvious significant symptoms of androgen decline, and you know, I forgot to add cough incontinence, part of that is in support of the levy terrain, a urinary frequency. Any prolapse these this is the result of that important pelvic floor muscle called the levator aina. And so if there is significant, already strong symptoms of that I want to get them started on the androgens pretty quickly. So what I'll do when I faxed in my first prescription include a prescription for testosterone and included prescription for DHEA. And most often I'll say, you hold on to those until you got a couple of weeks jump into the abayas and the progesterone. And when you're starting to get a feel for that, then you implement the antigens and I'll usually give them a fixed dose to do that. And then ultimately, they can dose determine the testosterone they can't dose determine the DHEA because there isn't clear cut symptoms and enough women for to give guidelines there. So there's no delay to androgen prescription, if the clinical decline is very obvious. When the ovaries cease functioning testosterone can convert estradiol in the adipose tissue, the more adipose tissue, the merrier. That means I didn't see a lot of overweight and certainly not obese patients in my menopausal practice. And in fact, when you interview some of these women, they say I don't get what this big hullabaloo around menopause is I'm not having any problem with it whatsoever, because they can be converting enough testosterone to estrogens and I've seen this on test results. That they're not symptomatic. They don't have enough oestrogen to produce an endometrial lining and that's men straight, but they've got enough to alleviate some of this significant symptoms of oestrogen deficiency. So Oh, yeah, a lot of overweight women are not seeking help for menopause. Now, that does not mean that they shouldn't be seeking help, because the consequences of hormone decline go far beyond whether they're getting hot flashes or not. And they talk we're talking about the bones, the brain, the artery, the bladder. So Need I say more. So we want to encourage these women as well and certainly check their hormones. If you're, if you're in doubt about it. I mean, you can check a menopausal woman at any time because she could say, Well, I'm not having symptoms at all. And you can say, well, let's test you. And you'll see the bonuses. I want to give you an example of androgen decline over the course of growing older, if you recall, there's F A again, this time we're looking at her DHEA and her testosterone at the age of 30. And here's two additional patients ms, and DK. Now, MS is 55, d k is 57. Look at that DHEA drop in to 141. It's a little higher, and DK. That 390 for a 57 year old woman is a very rich level, as I mentioned before usually don't see that much. It's quite remarkable. 55 year old woman with a 141 is far more typical, and then look at the testosterone from a 30 year old of 16 to 6.1 micrograms for 24 hours, and the 55 year old to four micrograms for 24 hours on a 57 year old. And here's the 62 year old, the DHEA is dropped to 33 and the testosterone are 1.8. And here's an 88 year old and the DHEA is dropped to 8.3, with young women having DHEA of over 1000. And this 88 year olds have gotten 8.3 and testosterone is down to 1.1 and the 88 year old. So look at that, as the ages increase the DHEA and the testosterone decrease over time. And I did illustrate that quite a bit earlier. That is how it's going. I'm not going to attribute all of that to quote natural, significant amount of it can relate to a robust are intense or over intense of a response to the stress in one's life. And not trying to get rid of the stress in our lives. I mean, that's not that easily done. But we can we have a lot of control, especially as we build up the knowledge and the skills and how we respond to that stress. And an excessive response is going to trigger a fight or flight biology. And with that fight or flight biology occurring way too often, way too intensely. As we start to reach midlife, we get declines of these crucial hormones that are really there for daily living. So what I'd like to say is that the clinical consequences of androgen deficiency are highly significant. And just to mention weakness sarcopenia, diminished drive diminished libido, and I've shown you this before, and there's an example of a pre sarcopenia and a leg that is lost muscle mass and of course, they can fall into osteoporotic bones levator eignet along with the other vaginal and bladder issues that can develop in the sarcopenia of the levator AI can lead to bladder prolapse and uterine prolapse and not desirable, then nocturia urgency incontinence, sleep disturbance and adult diapers. Ooh, me.

Let's talk about absorption of antigens. Here's a 57 year old woman and when we tested her and in March of 2012, she was applying 2.6 milligrammes of testosterone around her vagina in the area of her clitoris and pubic hair region, and DHEA she was applying 12 milligrammes transdermally to the same area, and are 24 hour urine hormone tests showed testosterone are 3.7 and a DHEA of 24 was referenced ranges between four and 18 and 2011 39. So that DHEA is way down and the testosterones not too bad. I mean, it certainly isn't optimal for a young woman, but for a 47 year old woman that's about par for the course actually, but here she's being treated, so that's not so great. So when we retest her, and we've got her on a different regimen, and this time we're giving her the same 2.6 milligrammes, but we're having her lie to her internal labia majora and intra vaginally so the amount is remaining the same, and the testosterone goes from 3.7 to 17 shows you the difference between the mucosal absorption of these hormones, the DHEA we increased to 50 milligrammes and we've given it to her orally, and her DHEA really got into a nice range of 664 and her metabolites literally difference there. The adderstone are initially 43 and 396. That does not compare to young women, and then it rises up to really nice levels 1703 and 2432. So where she applied it made a difference. And this woman is married and is having active intercourse. So there is going to be some residual in the vagina. But this is a tough call to make because she needs the testosterone and her husband picks up some testosterone and we know quite a bit about absorption studies that it's, you know, how many 58 year old men need a little bit of testosterone? Oh, yeah. So, you know, these are always risk benefit analysis, and have more to say about intra vaginal absorption later on.
