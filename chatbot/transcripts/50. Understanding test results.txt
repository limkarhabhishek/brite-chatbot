I want to talk about a core problem that exists in menopause medicine and Laboratory Medicine in general. And it has to do with normal ranges. And there's the reference ranges, there's normal ranges. And there's optimal ranges. And you know, of course, the laboratories are reporting reference ranges, let's take a fasting blood glucose. Well, it's between 65 and 99. In many laboratories, it was up to 120 was the upper limit of normal when I was in medical school. And what I learned pretty early on in treating women in menopause, and thus, in with all patients is what happens when you see a fasting blood glucose of 86. What do you think of that, folks? If you see year upon year, something that's moving up into the high 80s, that's an alert for me, that's when I like to catch them. You know, young people, they often have fasting blood glucose is 65 to 75, you start getting in the 80s, mid 80s 86, you probably have a creeping insulin resistance issue going on here. And so much of what we're trying to do with our patients is we'd like to tell them 10 years before they get into Frank diabetes, that there's something going on in your insulin glucose regulating mechanism. And so there's this issue with laboratory normal ranges and veteran physicians and nurse practitioners that I know they're gonna raise an eyebrow if they see a fasting blood glucose of 86. And that doesn't mean that there's any calamity going on No way. But it could be a hint that there could be issues down the road. Well, these wide ranges, which are most often standard deviations beyond the mean, these are very wide and take a look at that in blood serum fresher dial these ranges are 150 to 528, or even 20. For our urine. The reference ranges are between four and 26. I mean, going into any kind of Laboratory Medicine, your experience in your ability to interpret these with a finer tuning is going to matter to you because if the extremes of these ranges, these people could be very weak or overdosed. And just because of the width of the range. So this in this occurs throughout the menstrual cycle for what we're trying to measure here, including, of course, the mid luteal, which is often the one you're going to see. So when we zero in on the reference ranges, notice that work number one, as I mentioned, we're comparing them to the reference ranges of a 20 to 29 year old. And look at that green zone there. That's a reference range that I've zeroed in on and also between the extremes, the yellow zones, this is getting out further in the statistical distribution curves. But take a look at what these mid ranges are. And this is reporting the total potent estrogens this particular patient had a total potent estrogens of 6.6, as you can see, by adding up the Astra dial in the US drone, and where do I like to see it been eight and 12. So this 6.6 is a suspicious number for me, because in order to get the sufficient amount of benefits from the oestrogen eight can pretty much be the bottom line. Now occasionally, you'll see a woman with healthy vagina at 6.6, which happens to be the bottom line with these numbers. And if you've got a healthy vagina, most likely, you've got a sufficient level of oestrogen to help the bones out a lot of the brains, not all of them. And so you're learning to navigate within these reference ranges. And the more time that you're spending within them, the more you're going to get a sense of, okay, this is within the reference range, but it's a little too low or it's a little too high. And that's what the goal of these colour reference ranges are, as we want to get it in the green zone or close in on the yellow zones for all these analytes. And then let's look at some actual urine hormone test results. And these are of two young women. They're both 30. They actually were sent to my office, they were both very healthy, leading very active lives. One was the daughter and the other was the daughter in law. But one of my patients that was in menopause, and she thought it'd be a good idea to advise these young ladies to get the hormone testing. When they were young, I thought it would be interesting. Again, we're not trying to replicate useful levels and we may get in and also we may get a clue about her hormonal balance issues. But anyway, we did get the test results on them and I do enjoy seeing them that's for sure. lf was 30 he was grabbing a zero a bit tired, very active life. She had a normal BMI she was on the thin side. And FA was 30 she was very healthy gravitas, zero normal BMI hourglass figure and LF was a little thinner in FA had excellent libido by her own report. Let's look at the estradiol and these two ladies and also the s drone and you know, always easier to go right to the total potent estrogens. You just add up the oestrogen in the Astra dial and look at that they're both within the reference range of eight 14, I've got that hyphen 24. Because you're going to see I'm going to have some exceptions, but I'll talk about that later. And then here's their E three. And when you plug that into the oestrogen quotient formula, you see that LF and a very favourable oestrogen quotient, a 2.8. And FA was a little low side for estriol because we do like to see it between two and four. And there are exceptions. This is a third young woman. She was 27 years old. Her mother came to me because she had breast cancer, the mother and she was concerned about her daughter, because she saw many traits that were similar in her daughter as it related to hormones. ML on physical examination was definitely overweight. Though not obese. She definitely was short of stature and large and had large breasts. And those breasts were tender to her by history. And this speaks to oestrogen dominance there. And let's take a look at these numbers. My goodness, the e to the one look at the total poten estrogens 35 Oh my goodness, that's even above the upper reference range of 24. This young woman was oestrogen dominant, and as far as a ratio, it was less than one. And these are risk factors. Because what this is going to translate into his long standing oestrogen dominance is going to translate into dense breasts. breast density is assessed on by the radiologist. And that is a definite risk factor for breast cancer. And the pregnant dal levels which reflect the progesterone lf she had within range. This is the one I'm reporting just to show you what a pregnant dowel level looks like and a thin woman 30 years old. And also just a note that is about twice as much as drone as their as estradiol. That's not as high consequence. But I do like to see how the body is metabolising things. And there you go. That's a decent ratio right there. Now I want to look at a 24 hour urine hormone test on a 62 year old this woman at this time was not on any treatment. And we did test her upfront because she was one of the women who really wanted me to test her and her estradiol was zero that's really remarkable. She probably she was pretty thin. Because any woman with any amount of adrenal androgen output, testosterone will aromatize some of that to protect against super low oestrogen levels and you'll get some decent astral dial. So that's an unusual result. For a 62 year old woman. The total polled messages in this case are one my goodness gracious, with the reference range of total phone estrogens. Again, eight to 14 is optimal and she felt terrible. But I did have a chance to show you a menopause a woman in her before and after it because I don't have many pre testing on any women and I did on her and then the bias that she was being treated with was the most common 130 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and the total amount that she was taking was 1.4 milligrammes of estradiol equivalents, and the average of my practice is sum is 1.7 milligrammes of estradiol equivalents, or anywhere in the range of 0.8 to 2.6. Notice that, she is definitely in that range, and her estradiol is 3.6 restaurant is 11, and that adds up to 14.6. That's very acceptable, right? There are e three course and the first test was very low, that's her oestrogen quotient is almost uninterpretable. And then when she was treated, her e three was quite robust with a 4.1. Well, I'm happy with a 4.1 providing metabolization is going well, and I have more to say about that later, this patient was also treated with progesterone, and in this case, 32 milligrammes total on the oils, and we had to take this straight on through the collection period, of course, and she got a doubling almost more than doubling a row pregnant dal levels by transdermal progesterone. And now, this is the great news, she felt good. You're gonna see so many of these women who walk in feeling terrible women who, a couple of months later, after they've isolated into their optimal dosages, they feel good. That's what makes menopause medicine so

rewarding. Let's continue to look downstream with this patient when she was 66, three years after that second test, and look at this, she is on a different ratio by then, and you can be sure that I would have changed that ratio to 6040, rather than the previous ad 20 Because of a test result, and that adds up to 3.4 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, which is above my average of 2.6. And she's 66. And you know, there's a high likelihood that she could have absorption issues. And look at her e two numbers, not high, but they the two and the one add up to 9.3. So she's within the reference range. So now it's going to depend somewhat on clinically and Look at that change from her previous dose when she was 63 at 1.4 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent to more than doubling it to 3.4 over those three years, with a ratio change, and that ratio change can account a lot more for strength increase. And the total potent oestrogen is actually going down from 14.6 to 9.3. absorption. Of course, I never make a big deal of it with a patient and they don't know the numbers. So I say, Oh, we're just going to tweak the numbers a little bit. I never want them to think that they have an absorption issue. Never say, you have an absorption as you know, I just say we're gonna tweak the numbers. And when we get to the three, we wind up with a ratio of 2.3 that's, you know, I never would have changed it from 4.1 had there not been two to 16 ratio challenges increased estrone increase s 16, alpha, something like that. And symptoms, because I would have happily accepted 4.1 But now she's into the 2.30. That's a great ratio. And how does she feel now? Really good, amazing orgasms sleeps like a baby. That's a big deal, of course, and now we have changed her over to progesterone, oral 75 milligrammes Po, and we had her omit the progesterone. And she came up with a pregnancy dial of 2815. Yeah, this pregnant dowel really increases when you're taking it by mouth because so much of that 2815 is first pass. It didn't make it to her body, along with the oral progesterone along with increased well being and less total potent estrogens. So this is how it goes, you know, you follow women annually, you could sure see a reason for following them manually. And let's just compare it with that young person's levels and the total poten estrogens and FA was 12.4. So just to put things in perspective, now we're looking at a different patient. She's 61 At the time of first test here. Actually, this wasn't the time of first testing here, but this is treating her How'd she make it up to 60 milligrammes per millilitre, I never started there, I would always start on 30 milligrammes per millilitre, she must have demonstrated absorption issues, and I've known this patient for a long time. She was originally on 7.2 milligrammes of estradiol, Quilon. Wow, that's a lot. That means she's using a lot of drops, and she's on that double strength. So, uhm, very high, but like I showed you, at the very beginning, that doesn't mean that she's going to absorb so well as to produce total potent estrogens. Well, in this case, she did. She got up to 19.4. And of course, she would have titrated there because she was feeling well at that point. And estriol was quite nice, so that gives her a good oestrogen quotient of 2.8 and she was on progesterone, 40 milligrammes transdermal, in the oils with a pregnant dial of 432 not a high pregnant dial, that's for sure, and then we test her again is 63. She's on the same formulation, same amount of milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, this time her estradiol is dropped and restaurant is dropped, and thus your total poden estrogens have dropped. And so we're getting an absorption change once again. This time restaurant was reasonable enough to give her a 3.0 as oestrogen quotient, and she's on 48 milligrammes, she could not tolerate oral progesterone. This is a woman who had reflux and reflux esophagitis, gyrus. And in pregnancy, a lot of women get reflux and heartburn. And it's a lot because progesterone, the Gradall relax or among the many things that are relaxes are the pelvic ligaments to give the pelvic pelvis more expansion room as the baby passes down. That birth canal wants some flexibility, and you get it and you get it from the progesterone but it also relaxes everything else including the lower esophageal sphincter. So heartburn is very common. And so this patient could not take oral progesterone even though I would have liked to seen levels higher than 432. Even when she went up in milligrammes, she went down in amount of pregnant dial, and interestingly enough, she could only tolerate six drops, which is 48 milligrammes of transdermal progesterone. she awakens feeling groggy when she goes up to seven drops. So there's a lot of things in medicine that are imperfectly mathematically explainable, and this is a case of one of them. And meanwhile, this is another illustration of the absorption diminished over time. As far as hormone labs, my number one recommendation for 24 hour urine hormone Labs is Brian consulting labs. Also there's Meridian Valley labs with his Dr. Jonathan Wright's lab, and Genova Genova is a great lab. They do insurance bill On there's a few technical challenges with their hormone testing so I actually haven't used you know
