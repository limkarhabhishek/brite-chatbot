And then I realised that I skipped over some new testing that's being done. It's the spot urine testing, where they're doing five spot urines during a 24 hour period, or four, six, and you know, I had a little trouble grasping how that was going to work. And without going into details, scientifically, I didn't see how they were going to get accurate results. So I didn't gravitate and try out the method myself. But I have talked to doctors who have, and the strongest evidence that I heard was indirectly from a doctor who was using a certain Laboratory. He was one of the he was getting a lot of 24 hour urine hormone tests from this one laboratory, and then that doctor stopped using that laboratory completely. And then a year later, started using it again, and was speaking to the laboratory director, and he said that I tried that spot urine. And you know, it was confounding. It just didn't correlate with clinically. And I've abandoned the test entirely, because it just did not work. For me. That was the strongest testimony I heard. Now I'm open to any kind of laboratory testing that is valuable, and it is accurate. I'm used to the gold standard, I love it. So someone, for me to shift to another method, I'm going to want to see that the evidence is clean and clear and is excellent is we get from 24 hour urine hormone testing. So if something comes along, but right now the state of the spot urine testing, and I spoken to someone else affiliated with another 24 hour urine laboratory, laboratory, who's also done the spot testing, and he's told me that this, this does not work well. It's useful for very little things you can and you don't need it for this. Five different cortisol outputs. Because you can get you can learn all you need to do with cortisol with saliva, if you want to do that. And so this other gentleman told me that this was this test was not working out, like if it was said that it was going to now to understand the 24 hour urine hormone test that is a walk into the world, the universe of steroid hormone biochemistry as a prelude to the testing that you're going to do. And there it is, folks, one of the many renditions of the steroid roadmap, I'm going to leave that on the screen for 10 seconds, and you'll memorise it and then we'll be able to move on. Just kidding. And this is what discourages many people from the 24 hour urine hormone test is it's daunting to look at that, the analytes that you can get from that test. And it certainly was daunting to me when I first took a look at it, but there's a lot of help out there. These laboratories all have people on staff will help you interpret it. And anyone who's part of our programme, I review these hormone tests, certainly with our certified DAX, and then with any doctor who is a subscriber to the menopause method. I'll review these hormone tests in your cases with you until you learn it because it's a learning curve. Once you get it, you see the power of it, then you love it. So this is singling out the different families. There's the oestrogen family, there's progesterone family. There's the androgen family and the corticosteroid families. And we're going to burrow into this and I want to take a look at cholesterol turning to the great grandma, the hormone pregnenolone. And pregnenolone is hormonally active. Some have said well, why don't you just give pregnenolone and let the body do the conversion? Well, it's not reliable, what pathway that pregnenolone is going to go down I have prescribed pregnenolone and we even even have it in our elder formulation, because it has specific benefit for cognitive function. But that's what primarily what I prescribe it for. And then the androgens convert to the estrogens Wow, that's pretty interesting. And pregnenolone was also the gateway to progesterone and progesterone is the gateway to the corticosteroids and let's look at doing another lens pregnenolone becoming DHEA becoming Andrew Steena diode becoming testosterone. There are the principal antigens that there are and then the androgens either by testosterone by conversion of Angelina Down goes to the estrogens, testosterone converts to estradiol aromatizing it Wow. And understand down converts testosterone and estradiol and estrone are interchangeable. They move in and out of those two forms. And then one of the metabolites of estrone is estriol, and that's remotely active. And then progesterone. Progesterone is so efficiently metabolise that the main way that we assess it is through its principal metabolite pregnancy dial. So we look at pregnant dial levels to evaluate progesterone in a 24 hour urine, and then there's the corticosteroids and we'll go into depth on them as well. Now looking at this conversion of the androgens to s drone vi understanding that Ayaan estradiol. Let's look what happens at this point biochemically, once again, estradiol and estrone, are in equilibrium, and you can go back and forth between these two. And then the principal metabolite of s drone is two hydroxy s drone, otherwise known as two Oh H s drone. And I've got an asterisk and I've got it in blue, because this is the predominant metabolite of s drone. And this is the one that's the favourable metabolite metabolites carry with them certain risks or benefits, this is the more beneficial one. And as far as predicting general risk, none of these predictions are absolute, but there are associations. So we do like to look at the metabolites, primarily as they can relate to risk and more provocative metabolite that's not present in abundance is two hydroxy is is the 16 Alpha Hydroxy is thrown, and so we've put that in red with a little negative sign, it's fine, we want a certain amount of 60. Now, we just don't want an excessive amount of 16 Alpha. In fact, one of the ways that we evaluated as we look at the ratio of two hydroxy testerone to 16, alpha hydroxy. We'd like to see at least twice as much of the two hydroxy as we do 16 alpha, and then another metabolite of estrone, and a far less prevalent one is the four hydroxy Estro and thought to be the most provocative of the common oestrogen metabolites, and it's usually present in very low amounts. Now the two hydroxy is thrown can be methylated in the liver, to the two methoxy US drone, and that's how it is excreted. And then the 16 Alpha Hydroxy US drone can be transformed into estradiol and estriol is beneficial and it's hormonally active, it's certainly not as strong as estradiol. It's about an eighth as potent as estradiol and then the four hydroxy can be methylated in the liver as well to four methoxy US drone. Now estradiol has some metabolites and the two hydroxy estradiol metabolites is converted to methoxy Ester dial being methylated and that's thought to have cancer preventative qualities Dr. Wright goes into this in very significant detail. There are other Eetu metabolites.
