What does work? Well, all three, you need to know what the optimal dosage is to start with and the optimal ranges in which to the parameters to define for your patient before they start dose determining, you need to teach them how to incrementally increase the dosages, the rate at which to increase and how to address symptom alleviation while falling shy of excessive dosages, symptoms of excess and the imperative, you must do proper hormonal testing. And there's more. And well, this is one of the things that the menopausal method is about what does work well, from top of the crown to the tip of the toenail, A to Z, I find it imperative to have a method and algorithm, you need to have a complete and impeccable procedure. You need to have a checklist. So I was flying out to give a conference. And I sat next to a Southwest airline pilot, a young man who looked at the top of his game. And I turned to him because they already knew about checklists. And we had implemented for the menopause method for very specific reasons. I said, Do you use checklists? I've heard that they're very important. He said, Absolutely. And we don't use one checklist, we have a checklist for everything we need to do for starting up. If there's an emergency, if the engine goes on fire, there's individual checklists for each one. So let me tell you how these came about. In the 1930s, there was competition between Boeing and Douglas to produce the best of the aeroplanes with a war possibly looming, and Boeing had come out with a state of the art, this was a technical achievement above anything that had ever been done. And they'd already flown this plane. And they took it to the Dayton air show that to the Wright Brothers original field. And the plane took off shots, almost straight up in the air, and then crashed. Two of the pilots died. And three of the crew did live in oh my goodness, did this catch the attention of the United States Army, which was already starting to invest and choose amongst the planes it wanted. And what did they find out? The technology had improved so much. And there were so many things for these pilots to think about. That they had forgotten to remove the brakes on the elevator, which determines the rate of ascent of an aeroplane. And that's why it shot straight up in the air. Well, how are they going to address this problem, because this was a big deal. And what they decided was one possibility was more education for the pilots. But World War Two is looming, and they were getting 18 and 19 year olds being drafted into the Air Force and volunteering for the Air Force. And they didn't right off the farm. And they didn't have time to give them four years of education, they resorted to one of the oldest human methods in the world. And that was a checklist. And that's when checklists began in the aviation industry. And they are a religion in that industry. Because the pilots have so many details to do with that their training is imperative. Their experience is imperative. But they need to be able to go down all the multitude of details they have with any specific procedure that they have. Well, we believe in a checklist, and we have one for you. And this is also made it into the world of medicine. For example, it was noted that about three out of every 5000 intravenous catheters were inserted, got infected. And some of those had dire results, even death. And a medical doctor picked up on this did a study and saw that even though these doctors were technologically proficient, there were so many different things to implement in a proper procedure. And very often they leave something out of the procedure, like finding a hat or putting up a sterile field. And so the doctor made a checklist and did a study and reduced the incidence of avoidable infections to zero. Well, the surgeons picked up on that because they certainly have a complex procedure, new people in the operating room, almost every operation. And what the surgeons did is they developed a checklist. They go through a checklist at the beginning of each operation in many hospitals in this country. And what was their crowning achievement. They reduce the death rate from surgery by 47%. highly technical procedures, it was never a big problem around their proficiency or their knowledge or something that was avoidable. It usually broke down to those excessive deaths were due to technical dropouts in their procedure. What is happening in our checklist is every step of the way. We cover it from prior to the first visit to during the first consultation prior Prior to the follow up visits, prior to the annual consultations what to do during them, there's a list of things, it's not hard. And yet, if you follow that it helps accomplish our basic mission, which is to keep risk as low as we possibly can bring it as close to zero as we possibly can. We can't eliminate risk in the field of health and medicine. You all know that. I mean, I'll be grateful if I'm here this afternoon, or tomorrow, so many things can happen. But we can reduce the known risks as close to zero as possible. So what does work you want a method like they do for an appendectomy, before that appendectomy, there's a lot of things they do. For example, they learn whether or not a patient is allergic to an antibiotic like penicillin. During the operation, there's many things that are important to do, for example, to give the anaesthesia or to start an IV, and during the operation also to remember to remove the appendix or sponge count. I'm being a little facetious here, but there are so many details to remember. And the imperative thing is don't leave anything out of your procedure out of your method. Well, to get menopause as excellent as we want. I say that that's what we need to do. It's what the women want and need. And because of that, it's what we want and need, we want to reduce that risk as close to zero as possible. I realise I'm repeating that. But this is the mission of treating women in menopause with bioidentical hormones. We want to maximise those benefits. Oh, yeah, we don't want to fall shy of the dosage is needed to protect the brain and the bones in the arteries in the vagina and the bladder. Oh, no, we want to have substantial doses sufficient doses to do that. By the way, it doesn't take that much. And we don't want to leave anything out of our procedure out of our method out of our algorithm. If you want to drive a car, you want to have wheels, and that car if you want to treat women in menopause, with bioidentical hormones, you have proper practice, you want to have an impeccable method, it's imperative. One of the things that we're going to do throughout this training programme is we're going to base this method on your office flow, we want to set it up according to what you do before and during your first consultation. And before and during your second and before and during your third follow up consultation, and also your annual consultation. We want to talk to you about hormone testing, what hormone testing works and what doesn't, when to do it and how to do it. We want to talk about ongoing patient testing and monitoring procedures, which is something we do throughout the course of treating women in menopause. We want to talk about risk. We want to make risk clear to women, because it's a question they walk into your office with, we want to help address that proactively. So we can get to alleviate that any concern that they have. Right right in the beginning. And we want to explore each of the hormones of course and we want to also explore the bases that are used for topical bioidentical hormones, what those hormones are put in by the compounding pharmacists, we want to discuss some of the hidden challenges and common pitfalls that you'll run across. I consult with many physicians. And that's a service offered to you, if you call me and about your tough cases, let's talk about them. You're a member of the menopause method. And that's one of the perks of being a method is you can discuss with me any of your challenging cases. In over the course of time I've learned not only through my own practice, but through consulting with so many doctors, what are the most common pitfalls that you run into?

Let's talk about that first consultation. What you do before that consultation is you email or connect a woman with a questionnaire so they're filling it out. Prior to that consultation. We have a series of agreements that we even have the women sign, I'll have more to say about that. And you also want to have a procedure to have these women gather and get to you preferably prior to that consultation there prior labs, and imaging studies and consultation letters that they've had, and any HIPAA compliance documents that you want them to sign. Then during the consultation, you're going to learn a lot about your patient through the examination of the questionnaire in one way and also a physical exam. One thing about menopause medicine is it lends itself really well to not having to have a consultation in person that's now known as telemedicine. It does require that a woman have her own private physician, or gynaecologist to do annual exams into any physical exams that required so I put a question mark after physical exams, because you may or may not be the one who's doing it, but you do have to have a record of it, of whoever's doing it. That also includes the female exam, including the pelvic exam doesn't have to be You, but it does have to be done. And then you want to address risk as I was mentioning, because it's on their mind. And so if you understand risk, you'll have, you'll feel confident in your backbone, I would say and of course, during this whole presentation, I'm gonna have quite a bit to say about risk. And, and then you want to, during that first consultation is the final action, you want to prescribe for your patient. And you don't want to teach the patient what to do. You're applying topical hormones, and this is new to them. You got to tell them when where how to apply these hormones. So this is an instruction to do during that first visit, that first consultation is the longest one that you'll have. Then, in about a month's time after they've had their hormones for a while, and I've followed your instructions. There's the second consultation, what do you do before that consultation? Well, we have another questionnaire, it's a short questionnaire. And what I discovered over all the years is, there's a certain number of things that I wanted to know. And I always had to ask my patients in order to do a proper evaluation of how they're doing. And so we put that into a questionnaire that the patient fills out for you. And it actually arrives in an online portal of your private portal, personalised portal that you can have that follow up questionnaires. So useful. We send it out prior to every single consultation that we do. And then what do you do during that second consultation? Well, you're going to review that simple one page questionnaire that they filled out. And you're going to calculate the second dosage. And there is something to calculate the second dosage, it's pretty rare that even though they followed your your dose determination instructions, that they've arrived at that second consultation on that optimal dose, that's pretty unusual, you might have to do some tweaking at that second consultation, high likelihood you will, and then you want to set them up that at the right time prior to the third consultation, that they're set up to do the hormone test. And you can either hand them the hormone test kit, or you can have the lab ship the test kit directly to them. And then there's the third consultation. And before that consultation, you want to send out that identical questionnaire. So you know what's going on for them how much they're taking where they're applying it, are they stopping once a month, are they having any symptoms, and I always like to have simple questions around how they sleep with their moods, like how their energy is like what their libido is like. That's what's in that follow up questionnaire, it's the same one that you link them up with for the second consultation. And then during that consultation, when to review that questionnaire, because you're gonna learn a lot about them. And then by the most third consultations, you're going to have the hormone test results in your hands in your review that hormone testing, and then sometimes you will find that they have they're on the optimal programme and you don't have to do any changes, you just set them off for a year, with enough precision enough prescription for enough hormones for a year, we're not refills, but a lot of the time, you're gonna have to do a second recalculation of their hormone dosages. Now, this is the simplest and very common where there's three consultations, a very substantial initial consultation followed up by shorter, second and third consultations. And sometimes you're going to have a few intervening consultations short, but to help them tweak and answer some of the questions that have arisen for them. And then there's their annual follow up and we're religious about this. This is part of the checklist, we do an annual consultation. And prior to that consultation, we email the annual questionnaire, which is very similar to the follow up questionnaire, and we set them up once again, to do the hormone testing. And then we also give them any requisitions for blood tests, mammogram, bone, mineral density, thermogram, trans vaginal ultrasound, whatever is up for them, we individualise how frequently they need to have these various tests, other than the hormone tests, which we do annually. And then we give them requisitions prior to that test, so when they show up for that annual consultation, you're sitting there with all their test results and their questionnaire. So you review the questionnaire, you review the hormone and other test results. And sometimes they'll remain on the exact prescription that you had the man from one year prior. And sometimes you're needing to tweak that for one reason or another. So you may have to calculate a new prescription for them. And then you send them off for another year. Well, we have ours together and I'm going to review the background information and along the way unfold the algorithm of the menopause method. And here's basically what I want to convey to you that hormone depletion and imbalance from perimenopause and beyond is hugely significant. And thus you can be of significant value to your patients. If you are excellent with the hormones, the individuality of women and the variability of everything. Call for individualising treatment programmes individual was a nation. Yes, this is certainly one dose does not fit all, by a longshot individuality reigns, and then hormones are powerful, and harm can occur if you do not get it right. That means you give too much hormone or you give too little that becomes a risk to the patient. And thus it becomes a risk to you as the practitioner. Now, there may be risks associated with hormone treatment. Notice I'm using the word May. This is really inconclusive, but there is a near certainty of problems with no treatment or inadequate treatment. And boy will I delineate those in the body of knowledge regarding hormones is very extensive. And it's important and it's useful. And this is what we're doing together. I'm going to lay down a lot of that body of knowledge and give you references if you want to dig deeper. And then, as I mentioned, to this point, and all inclusive method is imperative for reducing risks as close to zero as possible. Women are resilient and you know over the course of treating women and menopause, many women were on Premarin for decades, for example, or it's urine derived oestrogen, and they did fine. And they wound up with less of a risk than untreated women. There's wiggle room so to speak, there's room for errors and plenty of errors were made. However, we're not interested in just working with a resilient population. You know, as a physician, that there is a lot of patients that are very sensitive and are vulnerable. And so we want to be all inclusive and deal with the most vulnerable amongst us and this method has quite a design to reduce risk as close to zero with all women. Welcome to the menopause method. Off we go into the detail
