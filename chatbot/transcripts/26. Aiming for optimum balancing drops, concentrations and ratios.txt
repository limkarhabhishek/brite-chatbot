Well now I want to get into some actual dosages, and this is the most common starting dose in my practice, like I say, now these days and for years 100% of the women who walk out the door have a prescription for biassed 30 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20. In the organic oils mix. And the most common starting dose is one drop PID, we're going to change that for sensitives. So, even though I've been giving out a lot of information, and you could be carried away and think, Oh, God, this is too complex for me to do. It's not it's coming down to a very simple thing. And that first visit, they're going to walk out the door with a prescription, which means you could prescribe to a woman in menopause. And your very first visit, even if you didn't know almost zero about menopause, which was how it was for me, when I started out. The Knowledge Base was very challenging to come by. There wasn't a lot to it. And I did have hormones, so I just they walked out the door with a prescription and we co discovered it. I say it's tremendous advantage to be very familiar and learned in the knowledge base. It'll give you an amazing Jumpstart. But it all comes down to what are they going to walk out that door within that first visit, and here it is, folks. That's the most common one. And PID I always split the oestrogen doses and I'll show you why in just a bit, and thus, you're going to be giving them 0.44 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent B ID for a total of 0.9 milligrammes of estradiol globin per day, that's a good starting dose for most women, because the average final dose for women that are dose determining, in my practice is 1.7. So about twice that milligrammes of estradiol equivalent. So you are starting lower than the average in my office, although some women are going to stay at that low dose, pretty uncommon. And of course, some women go higher than that dose. Now, here's an option. I'm mentioning it for completeness. It's been a long time since I've prescribed a creamer a gel, and there are a few women in my practice that are still on creams and gels, so here's a common one by us, 2.5 milligrammes familiar at 20 in a gel or cream. A pump dispenser is the easiest to use, but they get trickier to deal with when, as with incremental dose increases, and I've definitely done the full math with the oils in the dropper bottles. But you know you only with these pump dispensers. Technically you're you can only deliver a half ml or four tenths of an ML whatever pump dispenser you've got, but this is a very common starting dose for someone if you're going to prescribe a gel or cream, one pump, which is half an ML B ID. Again, splitting that dose, since there's 0.38 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, in this particular preparation, 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20, they'll be getting a total of eight tenths of a milligramme vestre dal equivalent a day again, about half the average from my practice, and we give the seal of special priority here to this particular slide because this is going to be go to friends that you'll learn very quickly. It's not hard to do this, and for sensitives, we're going to do it later starting dose, so we can do bias 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and the organic oils mix and we just start with one drop HS that's very functional for the sensitives it's 0.44 milligrammes rested out equivalent again, the average final dose is 1.7 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, in my practice, thus for a total of 0.4 milligrammes of astronautical and per day and an option if you're going to deal with gels or creams would be this formulation, you would just do one pump HS, why do I start HS? Because it's the nocturnal hot flashes and racing mind the adrenaline aspect that are so important to alleviate because they can interfere with sleep. Women do find they don't necessarily enjoy the hot flashes during the day, but it's not a big deal. But you get hot flashes in the middle of the night and you get that accoutrement of extra adrenaline and you get to stay up while your liver is metabolising away and excreting the adrenaline that got excreted at the rate that a 50 year old plus or minus years liver does which is different than a 20 year old liver. And of course there's individual variation on that. So HS alleviate those nocturnal hot flashes in the accoutrement adrenaline and thus the racing mind that keeps them up for hours. That's the big gift. So we always put the emphasis on HS and Now, we want to talk about dose determination by incremental dosage increase. For example, when we start with that bias, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20. In the oils mix, the starting dose is one drop bi D, and thus nine tenths of a milligramme best equivalent per day, after a week, in the most common dosage determination, we'll have them evaluate their symptom. And if their symptoms are better, but they still have more additional symptoms that they want to alleviate, we'll increase the pm dose first. So we'll invest increased to as far as drops go one drop in the morning, and two drops in the evening. Or as we like to call it, one and two. And again, we're honouring the give that nocturnal dose, have that be the most substantial dose if there's going to be a difference between the two, because alleviating the nocturnal oestrogen deficiency symptoms is a gift and important to do. And then gradually, if you're going to do another dosage increase, because one and two didn't fully alleviate symptoms of oestrogen insufficiency, for example, then we'll go to two and two, we won't go to one and three will go to two and two. And then if that doesn't work, we'll go to two and three. And if that isn't sufficient to eliminate this symptoms of oestrogen insufficiency, we'll go to three and three, will max out at three and three, and we'll make these additional drop increases, one week at a time, the temptation is to go faster. And believe me, I have done that done that experiment and look out. Sometimes you'll be successful, and a woman will get more rapid alleviation and will feel really terrific that that's happening for her. And yet, it's easy to titrate through that pharmacological window. So I say I remember Dr. Gates, he told me when we were in his office, you start her on, let's say, 50 micrograms of tea for or half grain environment. And you wait 10 days to two weeks before you increase. And I left, my days of shadowing doctor gave me I thought, when I got back to my practice, I can move faster than that. I mean, I don't know why it moving so slow. Well, I learned my lesson, the hard way, was moving slow, because he had learned over time, but you don't want to necessarily speed up that dose determination process. And you keep on increasing one week at a time or until symptoms of excess develop, in which case you back down a drop or two. And one thing that we instruct our patients to do is they're walking out with the organic oils, and we say do not exceed three and three without checking in with me. And usually we'll test them. As I tell you more about testing and go through the what the three and three actually amounts to you'll, you'll see why I say that. Now 100% of the women, when they report stability, that's often by the third consultation, which is two months after their initial consultation or three months after their initial consultation, they'll say, Oh, my God, thank you very much. I'm doing great. Well, at that point is my my favourite time to test. Say, that's great that you're doing great. Now we're going to test you to confirm that your dosages are translating into your body getting the right amount, not too much, not too little. That's 100% with us, we never leave out that testing. Again, I want to talk about these parameters of giving clear instructions not to exceed three and three. Well, if you do the math on that, that's 2.64 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent. And remember, as I opened up this whole presentation with that 35% of the women who dose determined, notice I'm not using the word titration. Again, it's because titration is so accurate. Remember, quantitative chemistry. And this is got more loosey goosey. So I'm weaning myself from using the word titration. And using dose determination,

wanting to imply the relative nun accuracy. It's a wonderful tool, but be careful because 35% of the women who dosed above 2.6 milligrammes restaurateur out equivalents, why would they dose above that, because it took them more in their mind to feel as good as they want it to feel? Well, they will turn out to test above the optimal range. These very careful goalposts we've put together from the medical literature and from the judge, just a tremendous amount of testing that I've done. And then 18% of those who dose between, remember this, I presented this at the beginning, the range of 0.8 to 2.6 milligrammes extra dial equivalent, they tested above the optimum range, so they dose determined right there in the goalposts of B Between 0.8 and 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, which is two drops a day to six drops a day. So that works out to be somewhere in there, they're doing one and one or one or two or two and two, etc, up to three and three Max. Even they turned out to be above the optimal testing range. Now I'm going to zero in on these particular issues and how you handle them. Because there are specific ways that we work with that. But at any rate, when a woman is stable tester, and here's what bias dosages my patients actually wind up with. Again, I mentioned this before the averages, but I wanted to get it right there up on the screen for you. The average is 1.7 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day with a range of between 0.8 and 2.6. This is the majority of my patients dose determined to those levels, which turns out to be between two and six drops a day divided, so it'd be between one and one per day or three and three per day or anything in between. Notice that I did not specify the milligrammes per millilitre or the E three two e two ratio I told you what we started off with that 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, but, when I'm telling you what my patients wind up with, ooh, I've left out the milligrammes per millilitre or the Eat three to eat to ratio. And that's what I want to discuss with you as we go, because the details of that final bias milligrammes per millilitre, and E three to e to ratio are going to depend upon applying the optimum amount of drops, or whatever other preparation you're using, to the skin bi D, optimal amount of drops. What is that? On the table, it is, it's five, total, two in the morning and three in the evening, that's the optimal amount, two in the morning, three in the evening. Because any increase or decrease of dose adjustment that a woman might make, from that, two, and three, when she increases by one drop, the actual potency change of her total dosage is only going to be 20%. That's very excellent amount if she's got to go up a drop, because she's had a stressful week. And she needs more hormones. And you know, the amount of hormones that a woman lands is her actual amount that does not stay exactly stable day to day. Remember that these hormones, they work wonderfully down the stress pathway. So a woman has that especially stressful week, she might need a little more bias than she's used to. So if she's going to increase, we want to have that increment of increase, be reasonable, and 20% increase or decrease is perfectly reasonable. But let me give you the example if a woman was doing one drop of whatever you gave her, and if you were wanting to increase her dose by one drop or reduce her dose by one drop, she's making a change in potency of 50%. So why would anyone be on one in one to save money? Because many people have figured out the trick, which is not so great for the pharmacist, who we love them, and we want them to stay in business. But they'll keep on increasing the strength of the biassed realising that if a woman were to land and two drops twice a day, that was her dose? Well, what if they just doubled the strength, then she would just half the amount that she's using she was she used one drop twice a day, that would cut her cost in half. But this practice, something that I used to do years ago, I do not do this anymore. And one of the reasons is the women are varying these dosages, throughout the year between the last time you saw them and the next time you're going to catch up with them. And they need to do that. And that's one of the reasons we educate them so that they can work with their life is it's actually unfolding for them in real time in the amount of stress or not stress that they're under in their in their day to day dosages. Moral of the story, it turns out that two drops in the morning and three drops in the evening is the optimal absolute optimal way for working with biassed. Now there is another way that we'll adjust these. And this is something for the people who choose to get expert at this. And we'll change that ratio because we want to achieve an optimal oestrogen quotient, who yes, is there some technical details to working with women that applies? Well, yes, because we also may want to adjust that E three two e two ratio and there are reasons to do that. Now, it first blush it looks like there are technical reasons but there Are they go beyond technical because what's our principal aim is to reduce the risk as close to zero as we can. And that E three to e to ratio is going to affect the oestrogen quotient. And it's also going to affect it can affect that two to 16 ratio, which, you know, we're trying to reduce the risk factors to as close to zero as we possibly can. It's also based on symptoms, because occasionally 8020 will not be your final landing dose. And the way you'll know it for certain is you'll see it in living technicolour in the 24 hour urine hormone testing, that the oestrogen quotient didn't turn out to be okay with the 8020. And you'll also hear it in some women with symptoms. So the other thing that we want to conform to is providing one month of treatment of whatever it is we're doing, if you'll notice, pharmaceutical medications are meted out, especially under the vigilance of insurance companies, one month at a time. Now, sometimes they'll get a little more efficient than that, but they're thinking in terms of one month in at a time. And there's a lot of reasons for that. And it wasn't just through the dictation of insurance companies, it happens to be that this really works out if we're the well being of pharmacists as well and we want them to do well. We don't want to force them into giving up prescriptions that are so inexpensive that they can't keep their lights on or their employees employed. It's a funny way to look at things but the longer you work with pharmacies, and especially with a much different relationship I find with compounding pharmacies, it's a much much more compute communicative and figure it out together. And gosh, I've had so much learning from compounding pharmacists over the years. So it's a it's a much closer partnership. And so Nuff said at this moment, but you'll hear me repeat this. So we want to get these prescriptions so that you're prescribing the proper amount for one month, not necessarily for three months, two months, or a month and a half even so, regarding milligrammes per millilitre, in the E three and E two ratio. There's also these many new FDA regulations that are about to hit the fan and June of 2018. There is a major changes that compounding pharmacies are going to be subjected subjected to and they really relate to new requirements for pharmacists and the compounding of hormones. And to comply with this and to respond to the request to make business feasible to the pharmacist. We are often changing the milligrammes per millilitre and you're going to learn more as we go here, why we do that? So I'm going to say for right now, details to follow, and then we'll pick this up this theme up as we go. So, once again, something to remember, as signified by that emblem of priority, that the most common starting dose with bias 30 milligrammes per millilitre, at 21 Drop be ID for the first week with gradual increase thereafter, and if you're going to use the gels common one, there's other common ones is bias, 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and that would be one pump, which is half a mil big for the first week. That's the most commonly thing prescribed. I haven't prescribed one of these initially for many years, but for completeness, occasionally you're going to need a gel or cream, and then dose determination. Most commonly you increase by one dropper one pump each week.

Not hard to remember, in all the while alleviating symptoms of insufficiency, while falling shy of and backing down from symptoms of excess. You may notice there are certain things that repeat several times because this will save you a lot of time and energy is these are the rack upon which menopause medicine is built. And then the maximum dosage is three drops or three pumps PID, regardless of symptoms. That's the time you want to test and you'll learn why if you if you don't follow. Go learn why you want to test I've ever learned many things the hard way
