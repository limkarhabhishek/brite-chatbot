Now, I'd like to take us to a new segment entirely. And it's the story of progesterone. Because before we can get into details of walking out the door with the prescriptions that a woman is going to need, we want to work with this other wonderful hormone that came out of the woman's ovary and a lot more of it came out of the ovary than did estrogens. And I always had been fascinated by these diagrams of the chemistry, the biochemistry of just about everything. Not that you're going to learn a big deal from it. But the basic configuration is the steroid hormone configuration. And there are some differences in the double bonds and the methyl groups and the hydroxyl groups, et cetera. Now, one thing about the whole subject of progesterone, is I could make a very strong case, that the subject of treating women in menopause, with progesterone, could be the very first subject I would present in any educational programme. Because chronologically, it's what women are going to encounter their need for progesterone first, and they could encounter that need in their early 30s. Whereas menopause, you know, average, not outside until their mid 40s or early 50s. So why don't we deal with the symptoms? Well, why don't we deal with the whole subject of progesterone first? Well, I've many times thought of doing that. But actual in actual practice, it turns out that most women are not going to show up on their own to start just thinking about perimenopause, until they start getting some very significant symptoms. And these early symptoms and progesterone are definitely there, as I've shown you with that graph is depicted by Dr. Lamb. That earlier decline and that more profound decline of progesterone, which can occur in the early or mid 30s. But that doesn't mean they're going to show up to your office. Now, I always say keep your eye on the prize, if you have a general practice. And you see 35 year old women and they've got a variety of complaints, you want to check in to their menstrual situation, and whether they're regularly menstruating, and whether they're getting symptoms that they didn't have when they were in their 20s. Because one of the biggest and best things you can do to a woman in her 30s is pick up on that early decline and give her some progesterone, she can even get it over the counter. It'll go a long way to saving her so much issues over time. But you know, a lot of words to say we could begin the whole subject chronologically with progesterone, but we're not. And this is that amazing graph that I'm referring to that earlier and more profound decline in progesterone as it relates to oestrogen. So you lose that balance with the oestrogen. So the optimal time to begin treating a woman in menopause with progesterone is when her progesterone starts to decline. And once again, progesterone is a very abundant hormone in the young woman's life. It's 100 times more the amount of the oestrogen. So we really want to respect that. And in previous slides I've shown you when you could start treating with progesterone, it could be anywhere along the way, the earlier the better. From the first signs of that imbalance, where a woman's just cruising through her 20s. And periods are unremarkable. And she feels good. And then in her early 30s, she gets a little breast and nipple tenderness, especially mid cycle. When oestrogen. She didn't have that in her 20s What the heck happened there? Or she's having a little more trouble sleeping. Why did that happen? Because her progesterone started declining or mood started. She's used to being basically happy and successful. And in her mid 30s. She's getting a little moodier. And so this is the kind of thing so she's losing a little energy member. Adequate progesterone can be significant in assisting thyroid hormone to do its full optimal job. It's still going to function. But it does better with progesterone. I asked the question to myself, decades after I first started talking to women about well, you want to check your fertility and whether you're ovulating do a basal temperature test. And what's going to happen is your temperature is going to arise mid month if you're ovulating and it won't rise if you don't. And if you put it on graph paper, you're gonna see that rise. And I always thought well because progesterone causes the rise. Well, why does progesterone rise? I asked myself decades after had been recommending this to patients. Because it has to do with it facilitates the action of thyroid hormone. And thyroid hormone is one of the chief modulators of metabolism more than optimal thyroid At the more optimal metabolism. And what's one of the principal byproducts of metabolism besides energy as heat. So his thyroid works better midcycle because of progesterone coming onto the scene, the temperature goes up. Moral of the story, well, women need progesterone. When ovulation gets intermittent, that's the next the next. That's the next stage. There's that earlier decline in just pure output of progesterone. But then the next stage is ovulation gets intermittent. And that can happen in the 30s, or certainly the 40s. And when ovulation gets intermittent, the period gets irregular. So if a woman said I've been regular every single day in my life, but every so often in my 30s, I'm starting to get irregular, I'll get a shorter period and longer or longer period than I usually used to get. There you go. She's starting to be coming in irregular ambulator. And when she doesn't ovulate, she does not produce sufficient progesterone. So I'm emphasising that because so much service can be done to women in their mid 30s. What protect their bones, their brain, their mood. These are big deals. How many women have you intercepted in their mid 40s? Or their 50s or even their 60s and they got osteopenia and osteoporosis? Not good. So pick up on this, why I'm lingering on this progesterone is pick up on this early and it's a simple service that does so much good for so little. You always are going to use progesterone, when you're starting to treat a woman for pre menopausal symptoms are in the menopause. So in whenever you're going to use an oestrogen, you're always going to implement progesterone, always. Very rarely, you're going to come in contact with a woman who's super sensitive to progesterone. And then you've got to deal with that supersensitivity.
