Let's talk about dosages. Women, as do men come in all shapes, sizes, sensitivities, there's a tremendous variation Woman to Woman and my goodness, why am I illustrating that, because that plays out in the world of hormones. And we want to take into account the variation that exists in the needs of different women, and their wants and preferences, and their sensitivities to anything that you give them. Yes, and their concerns and fears. I've already mentioned this to you. We bypass actual prescribing for a woman who I sense during the office visit is carrying a little too much concern, I want to respect that concern. And either give her time to learn more to where she's moved to who I really want this or I don't, we're not there to override a woman's fears and concerns. I'm there to fully inform her and I've written a book on the subject. So there's a lot of information available in that book as all the references that we want that relate to risks that are going to, but at the same time, we're not trying to override fears. And then women vary according to their knowledge and their intuition. And their absorption, or evey absorption variability is rather dramatic Woman to Woman and their compliance, and their response to the therapy that you're going to be giving them. And the money involved. Evey again, and their BMI and their body type, because their their hormones vary according to their different body types and their earlier life, hormonal configuration. And their risk factors are Yeah, and the amount of vital health they have and the amount of health adversities that they have in their day to day life, and the amount of commitment to their own health and their own unique life experience. So menopause medicine has a general principle, and it is respect the issues of individuality and individual variation. I can't emphasise that enough. And really, you're at a de novo from the beginning in a certain way with every new woman that you're treating. And there's a wide range of possibilities. And that's okay. That's not even a problem. In fact, it makes an interesting, one dose does not fit all by any means. And if you do an impeccable checklist in your programme, it becomes fun. Because this is not hard to overcome. I'm just stating the obvious that this individual variation does matter. I first learned about dosage, when I was had the fun and honour and privilege of trailing Dr. Alan gayby in his office. This is a long time ago. And I remember distinctly we went into the room of a woman we examined her. And we walked out of the room and doctor gave me said to me, this woman is hypothyroid. And you haven't got a clue of what to write down on your prescription pad. We don't know how much thyroid hormone she actually needs. But no, no worries, we'll have her find her own dose. And I heard those words echoed in my brain find her own dose. I had never heard anything about that in medical school doctor gave me went to medical school, I went to medical school and we had never been taught anything about find your own dose. And he said we'll just start with a low dose and see if we can alleviate her symptoms. And when we do, that'll be her dose. And if she happens to go over the top and she gets symptoms of excess thyroid, pretty easy to identify. We'll have her back down. We'll have her find her own dose and then we'll test her. So the major remedy for individuality and variability is not a problem. It's just we have our patients discover their optimal dose by clinical determination. And of course, I opened up this whole programme talking about that particular aspect dose determination, we start with the lowest dose, we gradually increase up to a hormone dose adequate to alleviate symptoms of insufficiency, all the while falling shy of or backing down from symptoms of excess. Well, in order to assist a woman to do this, we've got to know and understand the symptoms of hormonal insufficiency and symptoms of hormonal exes. And because our patients are going to be walking out of our office, and what I've learned over the years is the more they know the merrier especially they don't have to go to medical school, but they there's some very important things for them to know. And that's why we began the process of educating them with the initial questionnaire. And so they are learning right away. What are the symptoms of oestrogen deficiency and oestrogen excess, et cetera with progesterone and testosterone? And like I said, when They're reading that questionnaire and they're seeing that they're having some of the symptoms, it softens some of the concern they had, oh, look at this, it's probably related to ovarian hormone deficiency, rather than some mysterious illness like I've lost so much energy and I can't think straight. These are big deals. So hope is ignited right there with the original review of the questionnaire. And then we carry that forward because we have access to this wonderful symptoms card, which lists the symptoms of oestrogen too little, for example, and too much. And we've been I've been giving a version of this and iteration of this to women for over a couple decades. Be and you know, the interesting thing is 10 years along the way, occasionally, I'll say to a woman on her annual revisit, because we do have annual consultations. That's part of the agreements that they sign. I'll say, it looks like we could tweak your dose a little bit. You remember that symptom card that I gave you? And so often I've heard the woman say, Oh, yes, that's still in my bathroom drawer. Or, Yes, I have that pasted up to my, my bathroom mirror. Because women are, are changing their doses. They they have figured this out. And that's always been my hope. I thought this is one of the reasons I wrote, The book I have on menopause, is I thought the more a woman knows, the better she's going to be able to guide her own process. Because she's going to be on her own for so so much. And they do they learn how to adjust their dosages over time. And then on flipside of that laminated card is finding your own dose with progesterone, and also with testosterone when we list the symptoms of too little too much. So prior, however, to prescribing that starting dose, because that's another thing that's imperative in that first visit, a patient wants to walk out the door with a prescription. We want to handle different women differently. So first question we ask is she perimenopausal or menopausal. If she's pre menopausal, we're going to often treat her with progesterone alone. Although some patients we also start treatment in the perimenopause with bias and I've illustrated the different women that you would choose to do that with, because they still can be menstruating if they have a certain amount of oestrogen. But that may not be sufficient to, for example, ward off vasomotor symptoms like hot flashes and stuff. And then there's the menopausal category. They're different than the perimenopause, we're going to be initiate treatment with them with bias and progesterone. And there's going to be a small percentage of this woman that will also start with fixed low dosages of testosterone and DHEA. I'm definitely going to cover the androgens when androgen deficiency is so obvious and they're having so much trouble with it. By the time you meet up with them, then we'll also start, at least with a fixed dose of testosterone and DHEA. Eventually will dose determine with the testosterone in that regard. And then here's another question to answer right there in the beginning, and it has to do with how sensitive to anything is the woman we're talking about because you have met these sensitive patients, and we want to work with him differently. If a woman is super sensitive, we want to have a starting dose. And the rate of dose determination of increase of that dose will be lesser starting dose and a slower glide up into those determination. So here's how I assess sensitivity. I call women either regular or sensitive. And a sensitive patient will be sensitive to many things. And very often they'll volunteer that information to you right there in that first visit.

They'll say look back, when you go to prescribe anything to me, I want to tell you, I want you to use half or a quarter because I can tell you, I always need so much little than doctors are often want to prescribe to me. So they're gonna announce it. Not all of them, but a lot of them will. And they're sensitive. Many things are sensitive medications, dosages of the medications they've had in the past smoke, cigarette smoke, perfume, malls, shampoos, the most sensitive, they will not wear perfume, it gets them sick. They will not go into malls because the fumes of what's out gassing from the various products in the malls are just too intense for them. And they're sensitive to shampoos, foods, lots of things. You're going to find this out in the questionnaire, there's a place where we specifically asked them about how do you do in malls? When can you drink a cup of coffee if you drink a cup of coffee at night, the sensitive ones aren't gonna be able to because they're not gonna be able to detoxify that caffeine. Whereas regular patients so to speak regular, they're not oversensitive to anything. And so that sort of they draw a blank when you talk about sensitivities because they just don't have the problem. So they do fine with standard dosages of medications. Whereas the sensitive woman once again needs much lesser dosages of most medications. And the regular woman is very often in basically good health and quite resilient. Now, the sensitive woman isn't always but maybe in a delicate situation with her health and has some frailty. And you certainly want to think about this, the older patients, not all of them are frail, but a lot of them are, it's got to be a lot more careful with them. And then the thinner patients and especially in the world of hormones, so you want to be a little careful, they don't have a lot of storage depot room. So they're going to respond more dramatically to every dose that you put them on. And regular patients. Their bodies are used to hormonal levels of substance if they're newly Peri menopausal or menopausal. There hasn't been time for those receptor sites to go dormant, which they will do over time. So someone who's newly perimenopause or menopause or they're, they're often used to very rich amounts of oestrogen and progesterone, et cetera, and testosterone, at least decent levels of hormones. Whereas if you encounter a woman who's comes to you for the first time, she's five years into menopause, her body has not seen oestrogen progesterone or any substantial amount of androgens. For five years, those receptor sites it will go dormant. And you want to be we want to have a much slower uptake with a smaller amount. Now, what is a significant amount of time? Well, that can vary Woman to woman, I mean, some women, it's a very short period of time, several months where there are periods of stop thus signalling that the hormone levels are so low. In other women, you can go a year or two before those receptor sites go dormant. So you use your own intuition. You can always start low. This is not a problem. Also, if you're dealing with a woman who had an early hysterectomy with an oophorectomy early on in her life, she's quite likely to be sensitive if she especially if she's had no hormones at all. If she's had Premarin alone, which is often the case, and no Provera, no progestin at all, who look out that's projet. She might do fine with the estrogens you're about to give her she might even be a hyper metabolizer because if she's trying to get rid of that Premarin giving you a couple things that happen to women, or, and or she may be fine with any oestrogen that you give her because she's used to it, but not with progesterone. So you might have to start out with a lot lower doses of progesterone and dose determined at a much slower increase rate. And again, these issues are often related to the receptor sites. So I'd like to illustrate that. Here's an artist's depiction. Well, maybe not an artist. I mean, this would be my depiction of a young menstruating woman. There's the oestrogen on the outside of the cell, and there's the receptor sites. Inside. They've got a rich amount of oestrogen and they've got a rich amount of active receptor sites and bingo, that's how it works. And here's a woman who hasn't seen oestrogen for many years, for example, most of her receptor sites, oestrogen receptor sites have gone dormant. They're asleep, so to speak. So if you give them the usual amount of oestrogen, you're going to flood that receptor site, you're going to take away from yourself the on off phenomena by the law of chemical mass action. And so hopefully, this clarifies this issue of why you want to be careful for someone who's been many years without significant level of hormones, so no oestrogen for many years. What do we do? We give her a smaller amount that will, the receptor sites that she does have active will be able to receive it. So we start with a low dose. And in one or two weeks, we might increase the dose a little bit, and so on. Alright, increases slower. Administering progesterone to a woman who said dormant oestrogen receptor sites, you're gonna see a very interesting thing happen that progesterone will help with the sensitization of the oestrogen receptor site to oestrogen. And this occurs in the normal menstrual cycle. You need adequate progesterone to have the oestrogen receptor sites as sensitive as you want them. To oestrogen is quite an intricate and amazingly orchestrated situation, who's the archivist? Who's the orchestra? Director? I'd like to know. Well, we all have our theories about that. Now, I'm going to ask you a question. When a woman's receptor sites have gone dormant, how successful are you going to be able to be to reawaken them? This is an issue that you will run into with your patients. And sometimes we'll have to be very patient with them. And start with way lower doses. Sometimes we've got to desensitise because they become so some kind of allergic response they're having to the hormones that they never were in their life. If so this is kind of the the kind of intricacies that one deals with, in working with women and menopause. I certainly don't want to make it sound complicated or too complex. My goodness, it's fun. It's interesting, and it's not hard. With the majority of women that you'll ever confronted menopause. It's not hard, and it's very rewarding because of the results that you can get them they can be so dramatically beneficial to women. But the moral of the story with the sensitives is get their start and get them on lesser starting doses. And any dosage changes should occur at a slower pace. So we evaluate our patients as to whether they're regular or sensitives. And we prescribe accordingly.
