Now let's talk about the third consultation or other consultations beyond the third consultation, most of the patients aren't going to need more than three consultations for the initial process, and some will. And a lot of those consultations are really brief. They're on the phone or they're on telemedicine on the portal. And at any rate, there's this initial series, and we're now in the third consultation. And this could be the final consultation of the initial follow up consultations. Once again, prior to this consultation, whether it's going to take place in your office or on the phone or on telemedicine is the patient has emailed a link to the follow up questionnaire, the same one she filled out for the second consultation. It's nice and short, and not hard to do. And you're gonna have on there 90% of what you need to understand exactly where she's at. And then she's fill out that record for you. And your permanent record begins with everything that she's filled out. Now you can add additional notes if you ask her additional questions, but she's done the lion's share of the work for you. Once again, during the consultation, you're reviewing the questionnaire. And you're going to learn that your patient is either doing well or not. And also there are those physicians and nurse practitioners who test and we do it now. It's that there's those who don't. And we and there's many physicians been around for a long time. And they know that women run Premarin and overdoses a Premarin for decades. So it's not like, it's guaranteed that there's going to be a problem, I get a little into this grey area of I wish everybody tested but I'm very well aware that women benefit and decent medicine is being practised. And so I want to address what happens if you if you don't have test results, you're just dealing with that initial prescription. So you review the questionnaire, it's going to reveal whether you need a tweak to the dosages or not depending on how the woman is doing. So the dose that you calculated on the second consultation, the first calculator, the second consultation calculator could be the patient's stable prescription, if she's stable, if she's improved, yet still has some symptoms you're going to want to tweak. So we have a subsequent dosage calculator for this tweaking when the hormone test results are not available. And you might already know and have anticipated that the bias ratio can be changed. The calculator I'm about to show you is not the calculator to do this. That definitely requires the testing. And we've given it its own individual wonderful calculator if you want to mess with that ratio, which I caution you. It's for the folks, the docs and the nurse practitioners who really become an expert at this, because casual tweaking of that ratio can get you into overdose pretty easily. So there's two types of ongoing dosage calculations that can occur that without the test results, and I know I'm repeating myself here, the tweaking of the bias milligrammes per millilitre, still are occurring, and tweaking of the progesterone even changing the route. androgen addition is possible at this point, it's a good time during this third consultation to now bring in those androgens because they've had a couple months of experience with learning about what does this bias feel like? What does the progesterone feel like? You know, if you haven't given them by the androgens initially, testosterone and DHEA this can be a good time to do it. And then there's a whole way to proceed if you have test results 24 hour urine hormone test results. And it's pretty much the same as above, but with the possible additional tweaking of the bias ratio, that's going to be based on the patient's symptoms, and primarily upon the E three e to ratio on the 24 hour urine hormone test. So let's go through the third prescription this third visit that they're having with you which could be their final visit if you're not working with test results. And you can go online to the menopause method.com and go to the calculators in the members area and select the subsequent cancel quotations. And here it is, we call it the RX converter. So the first calculator which is called the second consultation calculator, calculated the change from the 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and then here's a converter to further change the milligrammes per millilitre. If the woman still having symptoms. Again, if she's stable after that first week, there is no need to change that dose. So here there's additional entry fields. I'm going to zero in on those of course, there's the adding of her name, and then these are the three that are the variables. And let's look at that first one. We're going to select the hormone we've selected biassed and we're going to select the milligrammes per millilitre because well, I'm gonna go off the last one we did. The first week you did was you brought the bias up to 41 milligrammes per millilitre, then the rest of these fields are going to auto enter because we know it's five drops, and we know that it was at 20 Still, and we know what the milligrammes of Astra dal equivalent per drop is and then you multiply that by five and you get the 3.0 milligrammes per day and then again you get to play with the symptoms. Like is it you want to keep the dose constant or does she Oh, this is she's got symptoms a minor excess in this example, probably develop some breast fullness and breast tenderness or nipple tenderness, and that's common enough, and as soon as you put in minor excess that's going to adjust this prescription and look what it's done. It's dropped the milligrammes per millilitre to 33 milligrammes per millilitre, it's kept the ratio the same, because it's not a ratio change calculator, 33 milligrammes per millilitre, as a different amount of milligrammes estradiol equivalent per drop. This is all out and calculated soon as you add in minor excess, the five drop total per day, that's stable because we keep that prescription stable. That'll give her a month's supply a little more than that, and then five times 0.48 is 2.4, total milligrammes US dollar equivalent per day and that would be the Tweak. She had gone into minor excess and so you're dropping her down just a little bit, and here's what you have achieved. You've kept the number of drops that he or day which keeps the monthly supply per RX that's very much wanted by several people, including the Federal Government, your insurance in the insurance companies, and also the pharmacist and then there's a slight decrease from 3.0 milligrammes restaurant equivalent down to 2.4 because she had symptoms a minor excess and sometimes these symptoms of excess they take a while to develop, because remember, these hormones are fat soluble, and if you've got an extra few molecules in there per dose, it's going to take a while for the the symptoms of excess to appear so no surprise that you're back down to lower milligrammes per millilitre and milligrammes that of extra dollar equivalent per day, because, again, these things will accumulate in the fat and then they'll build up and then all of a sudden out of the blue, you start getting some impressive symptoms, for example, so there you go. You send her on her way at this point, because high likelihood, you've isolated in to the right milligrammes per millilitre and strength for her, and she's going to be happy, and then you're going to see her in a year. Or if she's not happy, say, Hey, listen, contact me anytime. And then of course, you add that to the RX that you're developing and it's going to appear just like it did before.
