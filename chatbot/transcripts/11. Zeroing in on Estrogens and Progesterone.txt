I'd like to bring up some even more basic information about estrogens. Specifically in progesterone, of course, there's more hormones coming out of the ovary than those two. But let's zero in on those two. And once again, to review estrogens, they stimulate, they animate. And they can even help with stress because they can double and go down the stress pathway if necessary. And there's a lot of young women who have significant stress. And yet a lot of young women athletes who are stressed that they're sending so much oestrogen down the stress pathway, that there's not enough leftover for the female functions. And they're not menstruating or they're menstruating, very irregularly. And once again oestrogen stimulate breast glandular tissue. Hey, that's important, because the body once a month, is preparing for a woman's possible conception and ultimately breastfeeding so those breasts glandular tissue starts getting stimulated, right and that second half of that cycle, and of course, the uterine lining gets stimulated by oestrogen progesterone. Once again, it's the great Calmar it supports mood and sleep and it balances the stimulatory effects of oestrogen a very basic principle, and you'll find me repeating certain basic principles often enough, because the man wants you to get him. I thought, the effects of oestrogen were so beautifully stated in this that really a poem by Uzi rice estrogens make you feel sensual. It brings glow to the skin moisture to the eyes fullness to the breast clarity to the mind. It keeps the vagina lubricated and healthy. it uplifts and stabilises your mood and influences your brain and your bones and protects you against cardiovascular disease. Again, that's by UC Rice, a medical doctor who's written a book called natural hormone balance for women. I want to go through the oestrogen deficiency symptoms. We need to know him and the women need to know and the most common of these vasomotor symptoms. For example, 75% of women who go into menopause, develop hot flashes, night sweats, warm rashes, and temperature swings. And an accoutrement of this is the racing mind at night because we think of a hot flash in the middle of the night. Okay, that takes place a woman gets hot. But what's often accoutrement of these hot flashes and night sweats, especially when they're occurring in the middle of the night is an outpouring of adrenaline. The best I can interpret this as a woman's body is experiencing this as a stress in the middle of the night. Okay, put out some adrenaline as part of the fight or flight. And whatever. Whatever the causes, a woman can get adrenaline output in the middle of the night, and get a racing mind. And it can last for a while because a young woman whose liver is highly functioning is going to metabolise off and eliminate any extra adrenaline quite quickly. I mean, I remember, as a medical student, I would drink a cup of coffee at midnight. And then I have to drink another cup of coffee at 1am and another cup of 2am. To keep studying. Because my liver was so efficient, it would burn off that cup of coffee very quickly. Well, not so now. I wouldn't dream of having a cup of coffee with dinner for example, because I metabolise caffeine, much slower, racing mind at night, you're going to hear about that one for many women. And that's a type of sleep disturbance that can occur. There are several types. And then oestrogen affects dry vagina, dry eyes, dry skin. Because of the Dr. Vagina, there's often friction and pain on intercourse. And then because the urethral meatus is emptying into the distal vagina. It can get irritated from this vaginal atrophy that can take place and you wind up getting some urinary symptoms, frequency urgency and nocturia very disturbing. And then there's the mental aspects of oestrogen decline mental fogginess, forgetfulness, cognitive defunct dysfunction, sometimes severe, and I'm gonna read say have more to say about that is our medical literature reveals more severe cognitive decline that can be associated with oestrogen decline. Then there's often a general fatigue and reduce stamina and different types of pain back and joint pain, headaches, migraines, menstrual migraines. The most startling is the back and joint pain. I once had a patient who I met for the first time and I'm reviewing a questionnaire and she's in her mid 50s. And she's a high end real estate agent, selling the most expensive houses in the city that I was living in. And I run across that she's taking oxycontin for the last six months daily, and I'm still sitting there going, Oh, am I going to get involved with more than menopause here? She came to me for menopause. And, you know, I continued on with the process, knowing that I possibly was going to have to deal with that issue. And in five weeks, she calls me up and says, no pain dropped the Oxycontin. I'll totally, she wasn't an oxycontin addict. She was just having pain there was originating from insufficient oestrogen, I mean, think about that one, for example. Now, that's not the most common cause of pain. But you may find this to be true for some of the pains that women are showing up with. And then episodes of rapid heartbeat and palpitations. What's that from the adrenaline often occurs in the middle of the night. There's so many women that have wound up in emergency rooms, thinking they're having a heart attack, when they're when their heart is thumping in their chest in only to undergo cardiac evaluation studies and showing no cardiac issues whatsoever. It's from that adrenaline and then a diminished sense of sensuality and sexuality and libido. Very disturbing to many women. And weight gain, especially in the thighs, hips and buttocks. Oh, yes. And a sense of normalcy if they're still menstruating in the perimenopause only during the second week, which is when the oestrogen peaks, and then often a curious sense of intestinal bloating, you'll hear about that one as well. I'm going to put emphasis on the ones that are bringing women in to a medical practice and sleep disturbance is one of the main ones and that weight gain. This is women tolerate hot flashes. Yeah, they're inconvenient. But that's not what's bringing them into the office. So commonly, it's the sleep disturbance, it's the weight gain is the fatigue and route, reduce stamina, and it's the cognitive issues, the brain fog and also the urinary symptoms. Now I'd like to talk about some progesterone deficiency symptoms. Remember, it is calming. So you start getting into sleep disturbance, because you're not calming down enough at night and anxiety and difficulty relaxing and emotional problems sometimes severe because progesterone bounces oestrogen stimulation, you can get breast tenderness and pain when that progesterone drops, and even breast lumps fibrocystic breast disease and even more overstimulation of breast glandular tissue not balanced by that progesterone. And you can get PMS, fibroids, endometriosis, all from insufficient progesterone, then there's some other symptoms. There are some women who have libido decline primarily because of the progesterone. I've come to believe that libido as far as ovarian function goes, relates to all the hormones that deal reproduces the testosterone, the oestrogen and progesterone. But it's different for each woman. And I remember that we were successful and restoring libido of a woman in her 60s, primarily from getting the progesterone right? Of course, we were also supplementing testosterone and oestrogen because progesterone is a mild diuretic. When you get diminished progesterone, you can start getting water retention. And I always ask women, you can you take your rings off at night very easily. And women of course, are very conscious where of when their feet are swelling or ankles or swelling and they'll tell you about that. And then you can get fatigue and reduce stamina from a progesterone deficiency as well. And it's probably from how it interacts with the thyroid gland. In other words, thyroid hormones as I was mentioning to you need adequate progesterone in order to function at the highest optimal amount. And so low progesterone, less thyroid function, and then a reduced sensitivity to oestrogen receptor sites to oestrogen because, interestingly enough, while this orchestration is when there's insufficient progesterone, the oestrogen receptor sites become less sensitive to oestrogen.

Now, what does all this translate to I mean, when you're in a general type of practice of internal medicine or family practice, a woman not necessarily coming to you because she knows she's in menopause. She could have when you add up the symptoms and you hear the chief complaints, and you're reviewing everything that she's putting down in that questionnaire, you either come up with a wild amount of diagnostic possibilities like the chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic pain syndromes, degenerative brain diagnostic possibilities, coronary artery disease, psychiatric disorders, migraines, arthritis, diabetes, sleep disorders, your logical possibilities galore, and gi malfunction with attended diagnostic list for that. This is the differential diagnosis of the moment as you meet them. However, When a woman of Perry or menopausal age demographics comes to your office with a multitude and our severity of issues, I So highly recommend that prior to drawing any major conclusions or doing a multitude of diagnostic possibilities in your workup, help correct your ovarian hormones and see how much there you have left to do. Its will amaze you certainly has amazed me over the years that my gosh, we just help them so much with their ovarian hormones and so many of this long list of symptoms just melted down or reduced terrifically. It doesn't mean women don't have other illnesses that need attention, but I say go for the menopause and treating it see what you got left
