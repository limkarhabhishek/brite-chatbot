So now I want to look at the reference ranges, let's say for TSH. And the reference range you're gonna see in most laboratory tests are going to be plus or minus 0.450 to 4.5. Do I accept that range? Now. That's thyroid illness we're talking about, if you're outside those ranges, I'm more comfortable with in this range, I put in yellow here with a range of 0.5 to 2.5. And some would say 2.5 is a little generous, that maybe they're gonna go from 0.5 to two, or even from 0.5 to 1.5, they're going to hold that to be the normal TSH output low because what is the pituitary doesn't have to really put on a lot of TSH if everything's functioning smoothly. And then looking at the free T for its scale, of course, is different. The reference range in one of the labs that I use is zero point a two to 1.77. Well, how's that? If I see a person with a 0.83 T four, I'm gonna go. And that's not how the young people that's not a young person's results 0.8. So I don't call that within the normal reference range. My preferred reference range for free tea for the laboratory I use is somewhere between 1.1 and 1.3. That's pretty narrow range, and it's above one. Now, that's not 100. I'm not going to hold everyone 100% To that criteria. But that's the range I really like. That's that yellow range. As far as free T three, the reference range and laboratory I use is National Laboratory is 2.0 to 4.4. But is that the reference range? I'm going to use no way if I see someone walking with a free T four of 2.1. Do I think they're doing fabulous? No, I don't young people don't have very often a free T for 2.2, even though that would place them in reference ranges, the issue was reference ranges. So many of these reference ranges have been based upon a statistical analysis, again, of the laboratory going public, many of whom aren't feeling well and are hypothyroid. So these ranges are much broader. And I consider to be optimal ranges to deal with. So let me give you an example of hypothyroidism. Here's some of the TSH and eight, this person is hypo thyroid. No matter what that study does, you just run through the litany of symptoms and signs in your examination. And I defy anyone to show me someone with a TSH of 8.0, that that person is not hypothyroid. Come on now. And so this is classic. And of course, I expect them to have a free T for this below the reference range. And that's where the lower end of the reference range is 0.8 to 44. And it's not even anywhere near the optimal range that I consider to be optimal 1.1 to 1.3, and then the 383, that's likely to be quite low, too. In this particular instance, it falls within the laboratory reference range of 2.2. But when I see a TV 2.23 T three, do I think this perfect person is perfectly functioning No way. I think that they could probably use a little thyroid, of course, it certainly is below the reference ranges that I prefer 2.9 to 3.2, or whatever adjustments you have to make abuse in different laboratory than I am. And let me give you a different example of hypothyroidism. Here's someone that oh, this would be in the traditional grey zone 2.9 is 2.9, a perfect TSH? No, in my mind, I'd say why is that person's putting out so much TSH is their brain their hypothalamus, their body thinking, I think I need a little more thyroid hormone. And it won't be unusual for you to see that. Okay, they're within the reference range of retie for was 0.95. But that's not a young person's free tea for so I'm going to suspect that majorly, I'm not going to suspect it I'm going to believe it's hypothyroidism functional hypothyroidism. And same with the free T three G, this person came in with almost spot on into the yellow optimal range just fell a little shy of 2.9 2.7. But when I look at all three, and this is the value of having all three of these analytes i It's been decades and decades since I did anything other than examine these three analytes minimal. And I'm going to conclude that that's hypothyroidism. And why would you say well, it's not gross disease. Yeah, but every little molecule of help that you can give a patient can matter to help them recover. I mean, they can a lot of things going on by the time they've signed up for a consultation for your office and are willing to pay money or even leave their workday or their fun day and come in to sit in a doctor's office. Yeah, these are not ordinarily things that people love to do if they had given all choices of all possibilities. So if someone shows up in my office and I see this, they very often have got a lot of things that require Hit the mileage over a mileage mark. And so if this is the kind of example of a thyroid blood test, I see I'm going to treat that and no doubt, I may fail, we may give them a little levothyroxine or give them a long acting T three along with T four. And they may get jittery on a very low dose. Okay. Theory failed. That certainly happens. But this one is definitely worth a trial. And why I wanted to show you this one is this is subtle, but to me important, and you could be surprised. You could have someone's say to you on their next visit. Thank you, Doctor, I feel better. I have more energy, I'm thinking clearer, and I'm not constipated anymore. That was just plaguing me. Here's another example of hypothyroidism. Again, a TSH of 2.9, which many would consider don't treat that, not me. And their T four comes in between what I would consider the optimal range lower than that, but certainly within the laboratory reference range, and a free T three, look at that. That is even less than the reference range. That's an interesting configuration, what might be going on there, they got a decent amount of free tea for not an optimal amount of it, they got a slightly to me, beyond optimal TSH, and the most out proportionately of these laboratory tests is the free T four is a little low. What would I call that? I'd call that a conversion issue. I'd say that they're getting by they're squeaking by with a T four, but they got relatively less conversion in here. member, I said not everybody is converting that free T four to free T three, like they should is Dr. Wilson in the Wilson syndrome book that he wrote, I had a lot to say about this. And there's various measures to address this. And of course, desiccated thyroid, it's got some additional T three in there even more than humans usually have. And also you can use a long acting T three. And I've got boy a third of my patients that I'm treating with thyroid, or definitely have some form of d3 coming in there, because that's a common configuration there. And then here would be an example of a hyperthyroidism or excessive dose in someone that was hypothyroid. But you got them an excessive dose, you got that super low TSH, and you got slightly above optimal range T four now why would a 1.4 be considered slightly above optimal because you're looking at the 25 hours later, you're looking at the vapour trails, and part of that T four number that you're seeing has resulted from their dose that they took 24 hours earlier. So what was it 12 hours earlier was a 1.6? What was it 16 hours earlier, prior to that blood draw was 1.8 was a 2.2. So what I'm trying to point out here is we must bear in mind that we're testing these people 24 hours after they took their preceding thyroid dose. So the thyroid hormones that we're evaluating is what's natively coming out of their own thyroid gland plus what you gave him and yeah, previous dose 24 hours and look at that you got a very robust 3.5 Have I ever seen 3.53 T three in a healthy manner talking about a hyperthyroid individual or young person? No, that's a little higher, something's going on there. So in this case, I say they're overdosed and that's why the TSH is so low. Now, when I originally learned about this, and how to treat women, I learned how to have them determine their own dosage through a a, a process we I once referred to as titration and invariably when I retested them when they were feeling good, I'd see a TSH way low like that maybe point oh one or point oh two or point oh five and I called the mentor that I had learned from and he said yeah, that's what's gonna happen. You start treating this woman they're gonna you're gonna knock that TSH down. It's about as good as you're gonna be able to get don't expect to get a normal range TSH, so I accept lower than normal TSH is
