I now like to talk to you about oestrogen formulations, this quick with estrogens. And here we go. Because there is such a thing called right estrogens. Well, estrogens. What estrogens are there? Well, there's estradiol. This is the premier major output oestrogen of the ovary, it's abbreviated e two, and it can be interchangeable with and transported by a form called S drone. Otherwise known as E one. And these are interchangeable. And look how they differ by either an O H, or a double bonded. Oh, little bit of little bit of now a little is it binding difference there and different in effect, and then s drone, which is the central clearinghouse for estrogens can become a metabolite called two hydroxy es drone to O H, E, one. That's a principle metabolite. Notice how it differs there. There's the hydroxy at the to position and as drone can also be metabolised into something called 16 Alpha Hydroxy s drone. There's the 16 Alpha position. And then the 16 alpha can be metabolises into a hormone reactive oestrogen called estriol and otherwise breviary to Z three and look how it differs again in the double binding. And then also the two hydroxy can be methylated in the liver into a safe excretion form. And there's the methylation and the to position and then also there's an obscure pathway and not common pathway and with the estradiol can be converted to str and then also another metabolite of US drone, much less prevalent is four hydroxy. US drone, and that can be methylated as well for excretion in the liver. Well, let's focus in on the hormonally most active of the estrogens. estradiol is the most potent oestrogen, we assign it arbitrarily a potency of one. S drone is another very hormonally active oestrogen, it's about 80% as potent as Ester dial. And then str is about 1/8 as potent as estradiol. In fact, there I delineate the relative potencies. As we look into the history of the discovery of estrogens that we have the founding father of our country, George Washington, and the founding father of bioidentical hormones in America, in the world, Dr. Jonathan Wright. Dr. Wright had uncovered some research by a Dr. Henry lemon. And Dr. Wright wrote an article about Dr. Lemons research. He titled it estriol its weakness is its strength. And in his interesting articles by Dr. Wright, of mistakes that you can make and bioidentical hormone therapy. He calls don't become a victim of an all too common errors in biotechnical hormone replacement therapy. And this is fundamental error number three, not using estriol with the extra dial. And I've already listed the potency for you. And let's look at the prevalence. Extra dial we'll assign it a prevalence of one well as drones about two times is maybe even a little more prevalent as Esther dial in str is about six times as prevalent is estradiol. Wow, we think nature might think estradiol is an importance to it. And then this can be expressed mathematically by putting the amount of Ester on a 24 hour urine hormone test. That's how Dr. Women did his original research was using the 24 hour urine hormone test decades and decades ago, but Ester on the numerator and the sum of estradiol plus a stone in the denominator. These are micrograms of hormone excreted in the urine over 24 hours. And it should be greater than two. That ratio that means STR should be about twice as prevalent is the sum of estradiol and estrone. Well, that's just looking at what occurs naturally. That's called the oestrogen quotient are the oestrogen ratio. And here's an example of it. If there was 18 micrograms per 24 hour of estriol and the numerator, and estradiol was three micrograms, and oestrogen was six, those are the common prevalences. That would produce an oestrogen quotient of two. Let me give you some living examples of it. This is a 30 year old white female, who happened to come to us not because she was ill, but because her mother in law thought it'd be interesting for her to get her 24 Are you in hormone tests when she was young and healthy, and she had 27 micrograms for 24 hour estriol, and that's in the numerator, and 2.6 and 7.2 of estradiol and a stone for a ratio of 2.8. And here's another example. This one is different, same reasons for coming to us. Her mother wanted her to have a 24 year hormone test when she was relatively healthy. She had less prevalence of estriol. But both of them illustrate that there is a preference of estriol. I find this just so amazingly fascinating, like how does oestrogen work and oestrogen receptors work? Well, the oestrogen molecule goes into the nucleus of the cell, in links up with an oestrogen receptor site, oh my goodness, and affects the DNA, oh my god. And ultimately, there's production of proteins effective RNA and there's a change in cell behaviour. For example, when an oestrogen molecule reaches into touch that receptor site and connect with it, you can have an effect called increased proliferation of breast glandular tissue in preparation for possible lactation that actually occurs every single cycle unless implantation doesn't occur. In which case it's followed the proof proliferation is followed by a deeper alliteration, every menstrual cycle with no implantation. Oh, my. And let's talk about those oestrogen receptor sites because there's more than one type. They've been given the names oestrogen receptor site alpha, er alpha, and er beta. And, you know, there's an artist's depiction of them. And oestrogen receptor site Alpha when connected with oestrogen causes breast glandular proliferation, like I mentioned, first half of the menstrual cycle, there's preparation for lactation in case there is implantation, pretty ancient process there. And in the second half of the cycle, if there is not implantation, as I mentioned, the estrogens connect with oestrogen receptor site beta, which suppresses proliferation, and there's the proliferation every single cycle. Let's talk about what influences the oestrogen receptor site. Again oestrogen receptor site Alpha enhances proliferation. oestrogen receptor site beta when connected with an oestrogen is anti proliferative. estradiol binds to both oestrogen receptor site alpha and receptor site beta. Whereas estriol preferentially binds to oestrogen receptor site beta. Here's talking about these receptor sites with breast cancer risk. And ultimately, in this review article, the focus is on the role of oestrogen receptor side beta in malignant diseases where anti proliferative activity of er beta gives hope of new therapeutic approaches. And here is an article in which it is shown that estriol preferentially binds to oestrogen receptor site beta, notably, although estradiol has nearly the highest and equal binding, highest and equal binding affinity for both ERL funny our beta e one and two s drone and two hydroxy US drone have preferential binding for ER Alpha ovary, our beta was 16 Alpha Hydroxy Ester dial which is STR has preferential binding affinity for ER beta over er Alpha. You know, once again, str is nature's preferred binder, to oestrogen receptor side beta, which is the de proliferative oestrogen receptor site activity. And then there's other beneficial effects of estradiol and this article points out that it generates tolerogenic dendritic cells in vivo that protect against autoimmunity. After all, indeed, it has been known to be useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. And often there's relapse of women who have multiple sclerosis during pregnancy when the estradiol levels are very, very high. E three generates tolerogenic dendritic cells which protect against inflammatory autoimmune disease, and has potential applications in the treatment of numerous autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Indeed, well, if we were to design an oestrogen formulation, to treat women with knowing what we know and wanting to copy nature, how about including nature's oestrogen receptor side beta stimulant, estriol and treating with a formulation that will reproduce the oestrogen quotient? Two times as much afterall is the sum of estradiol and estrone

And you know that the most common oestrogen outside of Premarin that was used to treat and even is used to treat women in menopause definitely been used to treat women in menopause is estradiol, a loan, estradiol alone. No estriol, well to save you personal research time to achieve an oestrogen quotient that copies nature and to have adequate estradiol, which is really that what that's about, you will need to treat with estradiol plus STr, and you will not need to treat with a stone because interestingly enough, if you provide estradiol plus STr, you're gonna see plenty of s drone. That is similar to what a young woman has at least in ratio, and 24 year and hormone test, the very first oestrogen formulations, the bio identical ones, suggested by Dr. Wright was named Trius because it included oestrogen in it, until soon it was found out that the oestrogen was not needed at all. In fact, you did better to copy nature, if you just provided estradiol plus estriol. So what is ideal formulation? It's an oestrogen formulation that it includes estriol plus Ester dial otherwise known as biassed your love it biassed. Wonderful. Why? Because it's stimulates, with sufficient estriol you stimulate the oestrogen receptor side beta. Thus, you lean your oestrogen treatment into the world of de proliferation. We do not want breast glandular stimulation in menopause not needed. And look how they differ just the difference of a hydroxyl at that 16 position. Last knowing what we know about estriol I see no reason in the entire world to prescribe any oestrogen other than biassed. Also, you will not be able to achieve an oestrogen quotient greater than two and thus have sufficient estriol by treating a woman with Astra dial. Where did that statement come from? Because I've tried it. I went through a phase many years ago. I've seen because a colleague of mine said you can you can you'll be able to treat with estradiol alone, you don't need biassed and no way you can not get substantial amounts of estriol if you try and treat with esterday all along
