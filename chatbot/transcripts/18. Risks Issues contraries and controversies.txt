There's an abundance of literature that suggests both relationship and non relationship of hormones to risk. So I want to balance some of the positives with this is not a done deal. And you cannot say to a woman, we can guarantee you that you'll be just fine. No way. I mean, all of us are subject to so many risks as far as this yes, you could get it or no you won't relationship in the medical literature I have found that this type of yes and no regarding use or non use of hormone and risk to be common enough. That it's not easy to just say categorically that there is no relationship of hormone treatment in risk. Let's talk about risk and mammographic density. Well mammographic density was strongly associated with both ER positive and ER negative breast cancers. Hmm. Once you think that increase mammographic density would primarily be about oestrogen over stimulation of breasts glandular tissue, well, it isn't just about that this increased density. And it makes sense. I mean, dense breasts are not healthy breasts, they're not breasts that get easy lymphatic drainage to occur or that heavy have robust circulation to moving through dense tissue like that. The conclusion of this article is surprisingly women with high mammographic density have an increased risk of both ER positive and ER negative breast cancers. So, fascinating literature it is everything is like a friend and colleague of mine said, Boy in chemistry, it's math, one plus one is always two. But in biology, not so much. Things aren't always as clear and straightforward in biology anyway. The association between mammographic density and breast cancer may be due to factors besides oestrogen exposure. Here's an article on the incidence of breast cancer and the changes in the use of hormone replacement therapy review of the evidence a considerable amount of scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that the decline in the incidence of breast cancer and this was written in the height of the fear over the Women's Health Initiative is in large part attributable to the sudden drop of HRT use following the publication's of Women's Health Initiative, and the million women study. So here's an article saying UPS Yes, rate of breast cancer declined when the Women's Health Initiative study came out, and women and physicians and nurse practitioners became frightened of using it. So there's a tremendous decline in HRT. So can we entirely dismiss that the culprit and prempro is the Pro, the Madras oxy progesterone acetate, because that's what it's been implied. And that this is so entirely different than progesterone, that we need to have no concern about treating with progesterone. Why would I bring this up? Wouldn't it be just tremendously wonderful to define that? prempro bad progesterone Good? Well, things aren't that clear. And of course, again, is we go into the true cause of terrible illness, or really challenging illness, shall I say, it's multifactorial. So this is why I was saying to you early in preface, that the medical literature is not entirely clean and clear. There are plenty of breast cancers with positive receptor sites just for example, the mortality toll of oestrogen avoidance. Now look at the flip side of this, this is the yes and no classic and analysis of excess deaths, among hysterectomies as women ages 50 to 59 years old. This is courtesy of my dear friend Dr. Eugene Shipman. The results of over a 10 year span starting in 2002. That's when the Women's Health Initiative was brought out into the public view. And one of the arms of the study the print poor arm was stopped a minimum of 18,000 and as much as 91,000, postmenopausal paazl women died prematurely because of avoidance of oestrogen therapy, two sides of a coin. Yes. And now, it's rampant through the medical literature. I'm not here to confuse you. I've definitely drawn my own conclusions. Let me just give you a sneak preview of it. It's so important to treat the vast majority of women with bioidentical hormones for the whole their whole lifespan. That's my conclusion. And are you going are there some women at risk? I say they're not at risk from taking the hormones. I assert that they're not that normal reasonable dosages and I'm not talking about pre menopausal doses. I'm talking about the small amount of hormonal dosages it takes to get these wonderful jobs done. I have protection, I assert that it doesn't cause cancer. Now, excessive doses of hormones are not going to be okay. And the causes of cancer are multifactorial, and they exist over the course of someone's entirely life lifetime. And then really what my conclusion is the biggest challenge that face women is the sarcopenia, the cognitive decline, the osteoporosis, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Now, those are almost a near certainty for women to go on treated. So just to let you know, my own personal opinion, I want to give you my best shot, is I have long ago concluded the benefits of treating women in menopause. So far out, weigh the risks and those risks can be minimised by doing excellent work. So this is why we're here. With this, with what we're presenting here is how to do excellent work. Just to let you know, I don't want to confuse you from the medical literature. I want to tell you that I have concluded something. And I just told you what those conclusions were. And this is the conclusion of that article on the mortality toll of oestrogen avoidance not taking hormones, oestrogen therapy and younger. postmenopausal women is associated with a decisive reduction in all cause mortality. But oestrogen use in this population is low and continuing to fall. The authors of this article were trying to point out, Hey, listen, there was major consequences of what happened in a woman's health initiative, scaring women off from using hormones entirely. In this article again, our data indicate an associated annual mortality toll and 1000s of women ages 50 to 59. So informed discussion between these women and their healthcare providers, about the effects of oestrogen therapy is a matter of considerable urgency. They're saying, Why is there a lack of clarity regarding breast cancer aetiology in relationship to hormones, I'm gonna say it again, it's the ultimate causes of illness are not biologic and origin doesn't mean that adverse biology like toxins and hormonal overdose aren't going to cause you big problems, and aren't going to affect the biology but the ultimate cause of the illness are not biological in origin. And the causes derive, ultimately, from a lifetime of issues of stress, nutrition, toxicity and exercise. And of course, the caveat on stress is is not the stress itself. It's how skilled a response you have the stress so that you fall shy of triggering the biology of the stress response when you don't need it, you gotta run from a sabre toothed Tiger. You need it, bring forth the full biology, biological cascade, you don't have to run from the tiger, almost every other instance of getting upset, does not need the adrenaline, the cortisol etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, or the insulin. So, that's the distinction we want to make there. And ultimately, the origins of serious illness, have origins that we may or may not, and ever understand. I do want to take you back to the worst case scenario as far as hormones and menopause and risk is there is a study that shows that 40% of the women treated with prempro had increase in breast density. 40% of the women treated with prempro had an increase of breast density unknown increased risk factor, whereas 2% of those treated with a transdermal oestrogen developed increased breast density and I assert, that had 2% could go very near to 0%. Because I assert that those women who got increased breast density and bioidentical hormones did so because they were given an overdose. Overdose is one of the main things we're going to help us understand what we're presenting here. And the Women's Health Initiative with over 16,000 women treated with Premarin and prempro in a skewed demographic comprised of subjects with greater than normal risk when you dive into that Women's Health Initiative, my goodness, how did they do this study design, choosing women for the study who had greater risk. The average breast cancer risk with oestrogen progestin prempro used was 1.24, whereas the average risk with oestrogen horse urine derived equine estrogens Premarin, the risk was 0.79 Less than an untreated women. So it turns out that the Women's Health Initiative and the revealing of it has been a great boon to menopause medicine. It put us on the path of really understanding this more than it was like an explosion into greater understanding. And now 15 years later,

we can you can utilise the benefits of what that study unveiled. One moral of the whole story Risk is bearing in mind that with ovarian hormone declines, there is a near certainty of sarcopenia osteopenia, pyrosis osteoporosis, vaginal atrophy urethral meatus irritability, recurrent cystitis prolapse of the bladder and the uterus, adult diapers, canes, walkers and wheelchairs, not to mention loss of arterial and mental health, energy vitality, libido, hair, skin and much more. And not to mention, what we want to do is be as thorough and careful as we possibly can, as we possibly can dream of, and implement as safe a process and thorough process and impeccable process of working with harmless as we possibly can. This is the moral of the risk story
