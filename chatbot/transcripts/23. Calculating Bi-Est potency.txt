Let us do the math. And to do so we want to compare the bias dose potency to that of estradiol because estradiol has been the gold standard for a long time in gynaecology, we want to help translate this to everyone. Ultimately, it's my hope that gynaecologist all across the country pick up on the importance of biassed will our traditional colleagues still think in terms of estradiol potency, so we want to be friendly to them, and we're going to compare the strength of biassed to the strength of estradiol. So I want to introduce a concept called milligrammes of estradiol equivalency, milligrammes of estradiol equivalency, abbreviated mg e q, how is it equivalent to estradiol? For example, if you prescribe three drops of bias, 30 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20, or a half a millilitre by us, 2.5 milligrammes per gramme, how strong are these dosages? Are these equivalent to seven milligrammes? Xanax and strength like they're way over the top or are they too little? Well, let's go deeper to understand the strengths and compare it to the strength of Esther dial. Esther dial is the most potent oestrogen, so we assign it a potency, otherwise known as an Esther dial equivalents. EQ of one str is approximately 1/8 or times 0.125 is potent, is Esther dial, we assign it a potency or an extra dial equivalency EQ of 0.1 to five. Now we've got some wonderful math for your pleasure and enjoyment. So let's look at the only prescription with very rare exceptions that we've prescribed to every single woman. In their first visit. of our practice, we prescribed 30 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20, biassed in the organic oils mix. And as far as how much estradiol and estradiol are in that, well the percentage is 80%, estriol, and this is how the convention is for expressing the ratios and 20% estradiol the estriol is first ad in the estradiol follows the colon, and notice that yesterday was prevalent in one quarter, the amount is 20% of that 30 milligrammes per millilitre is estradiol as far as milligrammes per millilitre, well, that would be through the math for calculating estriol milligrammes familiar, it would be 30 times point eight, it'd be 24 of those 30 milligrammes familiar estriol and estradiol, 30 milligrammes times point two 20%, six milligrammes per millilitre of that 30 milligramme per millilitre at 20 formulation is estradiol and that again adds up to 30. And is in estradiol is one quarter is prevalent in this formulation, as is the Astro simple math. Now, the drops of bias per millilitre. We have done very careful and extensive testing in the delivery system that we use been that's dependent on the oils mix and the surface tension, the oils and the orifice reducer that goes into the bottle. I mean, a lot goes into this and we've done it very, very carefully. We've actually filmed it drops coming out of that dropper bottle and slow down the filming and counted exactly and there are 20 points seven drops in the delivery system that we use a bias 30 milligrammes familiar 20.7 drops per ml, so, the milligrammes per drop, that would be divide the 24 divided by the 20.7. There's 1.16 milligrammes of estriol per drop, and as far as yesterday, while there's 0.29 milligrammes of estradiol per drop, still a fourth quarter amount of extra dollars there is estriol. The relative potency However, while we arbitrarily assigned the potency of Ester dial is one and the potency of estriol is 0.125. Thus, the milligrammes of estradiol, equivalency per drop and GQ per drop, we multiply one times 0.29, and that would be a total of 0.29 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per drop of that bias, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, we do the same, we multiply that 1.16 times 0.125, and there's 0.15 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent of estriol. So then estriol has potency, it has eight the potency, so even though there's four times as much as straw. There's just about one half the strength, the potency amount per drop, and when we add up the estriol milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, plus the extra dial milligrammes of acetylcholine per drop, we get a number we can work with, and it's 0.44 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per drop. That's the potency. That's what you want to know. You want to know how much is a woman applying potency wise when she's using biassed this quirky formulation that has one of the ingredients 1/8 as potent as the other. Now, this can also be done with the gels or cream. I'm going to choose a common one here, the 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and we're doing the math again 80% 20% And it turns out that there's two milligrammes per millilitre of estriol in half a milligramme per millilitre, look at that four times as much of estradiol and that adds up to 2.5. And, again, yesterday was a quarter of as prevalent as the E three and then the relative potency, however, is one in 0.125. So the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per millilitre. Moving quickly through the math, you wind up with 0.5 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent of the estradiol per millilitre and 0.25. So, there's four times as much estriol once again, but Taff is potent in that formulation, and when you add those up, in one millilitre of bias, 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre, it's equivalent in strength to 0.75 milligrammes of estradiol, now very common to dispense these and atopic liqueur a pump, and a common delivery. Volume is 0.5 millilitres. So, every time a woman pumps that 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20, bottle, she's getting about 0.375, or about 0.4 milligrammes of extra dollar equivalent per pump, that's what you want to know, and if he's using it bi D, she's getting a potency of 0.75 milligrammes per millilitre of estradiol equivalent to that per day, otherwise known as 0.75 milligrammes of estradiol equivalents per millilitre. Now, how about its prevalence in formulations, because you don't just have to have an ad 20. But I say, be mighty cautious as you decrease the amount of E three, and you increase the amount of estradiol in any formulation, you're increasing the potency, because you're increasing the amount of estradiol by quite a bit, not just because of the math I just showed you. And we, you could walk through any of those ratios. And you'll see, and I'm going to do that with you. But again, the most important thing, you know, if you're going to mess with that potency. Why do I say that because I am, I consult with many of the menopause method physicians that have subscribed to and remembers of menopause method. And I watched a few of them on their own mess with the ratio, they increase the potency of the Astra dial thinking a woman needed it clinically. And then when they eventually did the 24 year on hormone test, the woman was an excessive amount of estrogens according to the careful parameters that we've developed over the course of many years. So it's based on testing, don't mess with the ratio be happy with 8020 is tried and true, unless you see 24 year and hormone test results that show once again, that there was just too much estriol on there as far as the biochemistry that that woman can handle. So she got an increased amount of 16 alpha because it wasn't converting test y'all. And sufficiently so she was getting a decreased two to 16 ratio. We don't want to do that what we know about risk is that's not a beneficial direction for that. So let me give you an example. Let's say that we did the 6040 30 milligrammes familiar and we did 6040. Well, when we do the math on it, I'm going to move through this quite quickly. Ultimately, one drop contains 0.69 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, recall that the previous at 20 at 0.44 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per drop, my goodness, by just changing that ratio to 6040. We made that drop 1.6 times as potent is the 8020.

You might want to go through this particular segment a couple times, because I find this to be a very important concept to get. I remember being at a thing, I think it was an a4 M or an a cam seminar, I was in the audience, and I was listening to his presenters. Talk about well one of the things that they thought were very important was changing the dosages to follow the menstrual curve and treating American pause a woman. Well, I've tried that in my past I, I have reported to you it's somewhere in these videos educational series how that worked out. But that was fine. That was a good idea. But what happened was out of the lecture, it was a medical doctors mouth because she was presenting, she said, and during the mid luteal phase, we increased the estradiol to eight milligrammes B ID. Well, immediately, two physicians leaped up in the audience went to the mic to introduce inter rupt, the lecture, one of them was a woman gynaecologist, who was irate, she said, those are astoundingly excessive amounts of estradiol. You're putting a woman into estradiol amounts in her body that she's never seen in her whole life. And you know, that that can stimulate proliferation of breast glandular tissue that is entirely acceptable. Well, I was so grateful, but this was way way in the early days, for me, and the thing that happened was, I didn't know that eight milligrammes B ID, was an excessive dose way back then it was quite a while ago. So I want all of us to know how potent we're dealing with here. I mean, this is how you do it, you do the math. And we've translated this originally into Excel spreadsheets, so you don't have to go through the math every time. And now we have a much, much more sophisticated upgraded version of this. They're called the calculators. And since you're viewing this, you're a member of the menopause method. And there are three calculators available in the Members section. There's the one that you use on the second consultation. And then there's one that you use on subsequent consultations. And then, if you have a 24 hour urine hormone test, you'll be able to plug in the values for the third calculator, if there's a need to change the ratio because of what I've mentioned a couple times already, which happens to be that you just got too much oestrogen for the woman's biochemical processing capabilities. And so you don't want to reduce the two to 16 ratio to the point where she could walk into a possible possible risk. So there we go, the math. And it's very reassuring when you know, when a woman says to you, I'm using three drops PID, you go, Oh, that's pretty potent. That's at the upper limit of what we've been talking about in the menopause method. Because what would that be through drugs PID? Well, in the ad 20, would be six times point four, four, that'd be around 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day, that's at the other upper limit is you will see throughout these educational videos, so calculating potency. Let's talk about ovarian hormone secretion in young woman, healthy ovary puts out between 70 and 500 micrograms per day of estradiol depends, of course, where you are in the cycle. That's why there's that much variation. Of course midcycle is she's going to be at absolutely maximum output. Mid luteal should be about two thirds of that follicular, she's going to be at the low end of the amount of est estradiol that the female ovary puts out. Well translate that from micro grammes to milligrammes and you see this point, oh, 7.5 milligrammes per day, or if we're going to compare it to the amount of biassed that'd be between 0.07 2.5 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. However, that ovary is putting that estradiol right into the bloodstream when you're used to dealing with orals or transdermal is you're not going to be dealing with orals, estrogens, hopefully ever. Because it's not the safest way to administer estrogens, but when you're dealing with transdermal, it's only a percentage that is going to be absorbed and get into the bloodstream. So I just wanted to give you something to compare it with half a milligramme of estradiol equivalent per day at the ovarian peak and a young woman, but when you I've just mentioned that, three drops in the morning, three drops in the evening is 2.6 milligrammes Westerdam equivalent, well, that's five times as much. However, how much is absorbed 10% 20% makes it into the bloodstream of a woman. So there's a lot of variables there. I just thought it was fun. It's fun for me to see how much the ovary actually puts out. So it comes down to the question of how many milligrammes of estradiol equivalent to bias should be applied? Well, we're not going to be able to tell by comparing the milligrammes of oestrogen equivalent according to what the ovary puts out, what we will be able to do quite excellently is ultimately determine how does it show up on a 24 hour urine hormone test? Are we replicating youthful levels not needed, not desirable? Are we at a reasonable fraction of useful levels, easy to tell? Because we know it useful. We have reference ranges for women between 20 and 29. That's my favourite to use, and 20 for our urine hormone test. We're not trying to replicate their levels, but it gives us a good comparison. And as you're going to learn, I have mentioned throughout this, it doesn't take that much to get the very important benefits of estrogens for women, oh my god. So again, only a percentage is actually going to get absorbed and will actually function of the transdermal hormones that you applied. What does it come down to? There is a right oestrogen formulation, and it is biassed and 8020 is a common ratio. If you're going to go to 7030 6040, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Be sure you have evidence to do so. But it comes down to a bias prescription requires the formulation that would be biassed, and that's what we've been talking about. It also requires a potency the milligrammes per millilitre that you're going to use. And it also requires a ratio. This is the prescription to the compounding pharmacist at 20. And it also requires you specifying what base in this case, it's the organic oils mixture. And as with every prescription, how much you wanted to have, well, the common one for biassed is eight and a half millilitres that's a month's supply, and then the SIG, what kind of application instructions you want, and also the route that you're going to have them apply and where you're going to have them apply. And then of course, the same would be true potency for a gel or cream and bass would be carbopol for example, or it could be verse base or all kinds of bases that compounding pharmacists have available and then the form of dispensing a pump. For example in the route
