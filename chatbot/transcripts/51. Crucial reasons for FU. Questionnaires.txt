Let's talk about the initial follow up exam. Well, it's crucial to menopause medicine. For one thing, patients don't necessarily implement what you communicate, I mean, there they are in that first visit. And you've said a lot, it's a lot to teach him, there's a lot to communicate, there's a lot to instruct and details and what they're to do. And just think of ourselves, I mean, I go to seminars where I'm just so interested, and I'm so fascinated. And a week later, I may not remember one or two points of any given speakers. So the common things that patients don't necessarily implement, that you're going to want to remind them of, is the monthly stoppage, the dosage ceilings that you prescribed, you could say, Don't go up higher than three to three, that doesn't mean that that's going to be remembered the big application rather than a lot of women will shift over to QD, which is a lot easier to comply with, and where they're putting it on their body. So there's a lot of reason to do follow up and ongoing monitoring of these patients. And not only that, even if something is slightly awry, so often the women feel so much better that they'll tend to go on tolerating something that if exposed, you might want to see if you could tweak to improve in some of the errors that they make is overdosing, and underdosing, both of which are quite unacceptable. And the monitoring can be delayed if they're doing well. And they'll self select around that one, women are very resilient. So most women are going to do well enough anyway. And again, sometimes they're so appreciative for the improvement, that they may not have their focus, and things that aren't going as well as they could. And that's okay. The resilience is there, most women are going to do well. But it's the vulnerable we're concerned about because being a physician, you know that there's a difference in the vulnerability susceptibility, the delicacy, the frailty of a certain percentage of the human population. And since our mission is to reduce risk as close to zero as we can possibly get it, who we looking out for mostly the vulnerable. And then another reason for ongoing monitoring is that every year I learned a bunch every single year, doing this, almost 25 years of treating women in menopause, and I'm continuing to learn great stuff. So our information and our approaches can change. So if you're seeing a woman every year, well, you can catch every one of them up with anything new that you've learned and want to implement. And then there's the whole issue around compliance with follow up, we recommend something I call the medical tether. Where if, at the end of let's say, the first series of consultations where the woman has arrived, and is feeling good, and you've tested her, and you've either tweaked slightly, but not so much that you wouldn't need to test again, or you she's on the optimal dosage and to say, Great, we'll see a year later, when you're writing prescriptions that last month, you write enough prescriptions so that at the 11 month mark, they're starting to hear from your office, because we put all this on a calendar, and we send them the questionnaire, we send them the requisitions. And I like it when a woman makes an actual appointment for one year out. And of course, it's fine to change. But that means that's on the books, but even the medical tether, you've only written enough prescriptions for a year, that worst case scenario, they're going to be able to make it a year and two months, four months, maybe even a year and a half. But that's fine. That's no big deal a year and a half. So the medical together, you're writing up prescriptions, and when that means when I get in my office, or I get a request from the pharmacy to the patient needs refills. I know if that request comes in the medical tether has been exceeded. And so it's time to connect with the patients. So I sure don't ever want a woman to be out of hormones. So I'll sure write a month's worth of prescriptions. But that's all they'll get. And then they'll get an email from our office saying, hey, time for your annual pleasure cruise, where we get to do a follow up consultation. Now. That's annual, but remember, we know that that initial process with a woman is a process and it begins with that first visit which is definitely the longest. And there we review the history. We review that questionnaire and I review it line item by line item. That questionnaire summarises everything that's really important. On the bulk of that questionnaire, many pages and two page and a half a summary. And even though I treasure that summary page, I go line item through the whole questionnaire and then annually are on any follow up visit. If I want to learn really quickly, I'm going to go to that summary page. And then it's whether or not you're going to do the physical and female exam. It's so easy for you to be primarily the hormone doctor and or the functional doctor for a woman and have her family physician or her gynaecologist do the physical exams and the female exams. So then there's the initial treatments that you're going to do. And then there's subsequent consultations after that initial treatment programme. And how many of those are going to need Well, optimal was two and it's minimal to you're gonna see her five weeks after that first visit, that gives her a week to pick up her prescriptions or getting them shipped to her and four weeks to really see how she does with bias and progesterone usually, sometimes there's DHEA and testosterone in that mix, but 90% of the time is not, and then get a real feel for the bias and progesterone so that that one month after they've begun, the actual hormone usage is an ideal time intersect with them. And then often you'll do some tweaking of that month based on symptoms. And of course, to keep the prescription to a month, you're going to need to recalculate the milligrammes per millilitre, and then also eight to 12 weeks after that first visit, and it's good to schedule that certainly at the second visit. Now, are there more consultations? Sometimes? Yes. And what I encourage my patients to do and they're all concerned about cost, or most are, I'll say, look, the least expensive way to do this whole process with me, is every time you have a significant question or two, you email me and set up a phone consultation or a telemedicine consultation. And we'll deal with it right then and there. And you may think, why don't want to rack up a lot of time, and consulting time and thus cost. And I'll say yes, but if we handled things earlier, it saves time and energy and money. And I know that so I speak that with assurance, and they believe it as well. And again, they can be telephone consultations very easily. I learned as I got into my practice, that so many things can be handled so easily over the phone, people don't have to get in their car, drive down your office drive back interrupt their day. And that makes them more inclined to actually deal with things as they come up. So again, more than two additional consultations may be required. And they can be brief. And my own email policy is that by the time I see two sentences in an email, I know that we need to have a phone consultation. So I say the fastest thing you can do and say, Hey, Doc, I need let me set up a consultation call the office to do that set up the time. And I also am very clear upfront that I always charge for my time. Now I like to give some relief to my patients who they don't like them to feel like they're on a metre and I say, Listen, if you if you record the time to you're going to see that it's very rare that I charge you for the full time. Because if I'm moving a little slower if I'm thinking out loud, or if I'm fumbling through my computer to pull up documents, I don't want you to have to pay for that. And I don't have to be concerned about that. And if I know that I'm moving in a little slower pace than I usually do, you will find me make the adjustments. And I'm very generous about that. But I do let them know that they can count on me for charging for their time. And I just don't find that emails work. Sometimes I'll say to a patient, okay, we're going to start micromanaging your situation, I want to hear from you in an email from you every single day to see exactly how you're doing. And that doesn't mean I'm going to respond to that unless I think it's necessary. And if I do respond, we're going to have a phone consultation. So that's my only exception email, I'm happy to read an email from a patient that keep me in the loop. And I will not charge them for that. And I just tell them that I never do email consultations going back and forth. They just don't work well for me, they might work very well for you. And the the shout the charging is challenging. So that's how I charge. And as a woman approaches satisfaction, meaning on one of your phone consultations or in person consultation, she's saying she had been so much better. And you listen to the details of how she's doing and you go, wow, she is approaching bingo here. Then we set up the 24 year on hormone tests, we give it to her in the office, or it's very easy. With the lab, I used to just have it shipped directly to her. And we do that around the second consultation, at least you know, around the one month mark there. And then the follow up questionnaire is sent prior to every consultation because I learned over time that if a woman has an issue, there's going to be a certain amount of basic details that I really want to know including what's Yan how much is she on? Where she applying it is she doing by SBI d and if you look at our questionnaire

But you can have that you do have as members of the menopause method, you'll see all the questions that I consider really germane. I asked her about a whole bunch of symptoms. And I asked her the basics that I always love. I always love to know about her energy, her mood, her sleep, and her exit her exercise and her libido. And so sitting with that follow up questionnaire in front of me, I know so much about her, I don't have to take notes, it's part of my permanent record, she's filled it out online, it's gone to the HIPAA secure portal. And then we can work from there. patients really appreciate that because they know that's a savings of time, they're not going to have to sit there and answer individual questions to me, it's unless it's a savings of money, follow up questionnaire prior to every follow up visit. Once you start using it, you'll see how excellent that is. And there is an example of our online follow up questionnaire. And this actually goes to a HIPAA approved a HIPAA secure portal, both secure and approved. And then when they're done filling it out, they press the submit button, and then it goes to that portal. And you can make a PDF out of it. And this is the version that you see. And really all the details that we want to know. Let me give you an example of what we asked them and what hormone Are you on starting with biassed? And what's the strength that you're on? I've got a record that in the office, but I'd like them to know this and to actually notate it and these are all drop down lists. So they're really easy to work with. So in this case, she's choosing 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20. And then what basis are you using? Well, 95% of the time in my practice, it's the organic oils, and then what dosage is she on? I want to know number one on that bias is she dividing that dose like we so much wanting to do, and here's the reporting three drops in the morning and three drops in the evening. And then I want to know where she applying it, I want to know everything because you're gonna absorption is such a key thing. And you're going to learn a lot from that. So in this case, she's applying to the soft form and now we go to progesterone. And then this is how the follow up consultation comes to you. And in this first section, your she again she's listening to hormone, the strength, the base, the dosage and time and location. In this section, the day of the month she begins each one of the hormones so there's a question there for bias, testosterone, progesterone and DHEA. Each day of the month, you begin and and your oestrogen, progesterone, testosterone and DHEA. And this is one of the most common things that we see that over time patients forget to do until we really emphasise that to them that we want that once a month stoppage and there's a long list of symptoms or hormonal insufficiency in excess. Of course, what we're trying to sort out there is get clues about overdose and underdose. We're not going to get absolute. And I illustrated to you at the very beginning of this whole teaching programme. I'm telling you some of the things that we list there hot flashes, warm rushes night sweats, kicking the covers off sleep disturbance, awaking with a racing mind they sound familiar. These are oestrogen deficiency symptoms along with vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, use of lubrication during intercourse. These are important markers and then on the flip side, symptoms of excess breast tenderness, nipple tenderness, breast pain, breast fullness, weight gain times up at night to urinate, pubic hair loss loss of urine and cough. Yes, we're trying to figure it out symptoms of insufficiency and excess and those symptoms of excess are very reliable, but about 25% of Marte. That means they think they're doing fine. They're not having any breast symptoms. And yet when we test them, they are on overdose. So you need a lot of data points to get this thing really right, including the bottom line which is a 24 hour urine hormone test and then I like them to rate on a scale of zero to 10 their energy memory libido sleep and mood because oh my want to know how someone's doing in their life. Ask them those questions.
