In a previous video, I detailed some of the importance to the community of pilots, intravenous catheter plaisirs. And surgeons have a checklist. It's not like we don't have excellent training and experience but there's so many moving parts. In the work that we do and we're trying to get menopause medicine is absolutely excellent is possible in which we're we ducing the risk as close to zero as we can and maximise the many crucial benefits for women, that I find that a checklist serves, I practice so well and makes it so much easier. And I can sleep easily because I'm not missing any pieces of a mini peace process. So whether you design your own checklist or whether you use ours, I think it's worth looking at ours because there's a lot of elements there that have stood stood the test of time. And I caution you from omitting any of those elements from this. And what we recommend is that you actually go so far as to print out a checklist for each patient, put it on their chart, and as you go as you fulfil the different items that you actually check it off. Now we organise this checklist, according to the practice flow. So the very first thing I'm going to cover in this video is the first consultation. And the first consultation begins prior to the first consultation, because there's so much information that we want to gather during that for that first consultation. And so much of it can be done by the patient with you just emailing questionnaires and forms to them. And it begins in our practice with a series of consultation agreements, that the patient reviews and signs. And how this arose is a perfect example of it occurred just a couple of weeks ago, when one of our certified physicians met a new patient went through the whole initial history and physical and was deeply embarked into the instruction phase of how to determine dosage and, and at a certain point, she said, and I'd like annual manual grant mammogram for you and I'd like to read up right on requisition for one now because they see you haven't had one recently, and the woman said I don't do mammograms. And then thus ensued a conversation and ultimately a phone call in which the doctor called the patient and said that I just don't feel comfortable engaging in this medical process with you without you being willing to do mammograms and the patient baulked again and the physician refunded the money and couldn't refund her time. Her own time to her and this is how I originally learned it. So what we like to do is we like to inform the patients right up front. This is what the menopause process looks like. And I'd like to review some of the elements of that. One is we like the patient to know that it is a process that it doesn't come to the first consultation, you walk out and everything is done for a year and you you have enough prescriptions for a year, no way it's an initial process. The most significant part of that process is the very first consultation in which the traditional history and physical is done and a lot of instruction on how to dose determine and what's going to take place during the second and third consultations are going to be tuneups are going to be you gathering information about how the woman actually did as she marched out the door and spent a month with her hormones. And then a third consultation in which you're also reviewing testing, we'd like the patient to know that it's a process. And it could be even more than two or three or four initial consultations. It could be whatever it takes to determine dose and confirm it by testing. At which point, there are annual consultations. Once a year you review the patient's whole hormonal situation. The other thing we like patients to know is there is a series of initial tests and imaging that we like to have both initially and annually. And we give them a list and I'm gonna review that list with you at another time. And then we have the patient actually signed that agreement for him. So there's no surprises. A urine to the processes once happened to me when I asked for a mammogram one year later. And that was the end of the relationship with that patient. So there's no surprises the patient knows what they're getting into and feel feels good about it because this is a process you want to feel good about right out of the gate, the checklist and all the documents that are tools that we offer can be found in this member section. Now then Next step is the questionnaire. How wonderful to have a patient at their leisure, fill out every extensive question that you have for her to learn about her medical situation. And menopause medicine is a little unique, because the more you know about female hormones and menopause, the more questions you're gonna want to have the answers to. So the easiest way to do this is to have a questionnaire for that patient and have her fill it out prior to that first visit, saves you time saves her time and money. And there you are, she's filled out your very first medical record for you. And yes, you will have some additional notes that you'll take but the backbone of it, the basis of it is going to be however you acquire that questionnaire, we actually have a questionnaire that because you're a member of the menopause method, you have full access to as your own, you can procure your own HIPAA secure HIPAA approved portal, and you send a link, prior to that first visit to the patient to that questionnaire that's on that portal. And when they're finished, they submit it and it appears on the portal as a permanent record. Or it can be downloaded as a PDF to integrate with your medical record system. Bottom line, they show up at that first visit, because you've done the prior work for them. You've gotten them a link to an A wonderful questionnaire. And then prior to that first visit, you want to request from the patient that they get to you. Any significant laboratory or imaging reports or consultation reports, pathology reports, whichever it whatever is relevant, you want to inform them and how to get that procure those from their other physicians. And perhaps they have their own medical records. But you however you want them conveyed to you either by fax to your office, which is what we do, because then our matter automatically appears on our computers, or you they show up in the office and you scan those documents at any rate for that first visit. They've done the prior lifting for you. They've gotten you them the relevant laboratory tests. And also you will have your own HIPAA agreements that you want them to sign. And you might have some specifics to how you want your medical practice to flow, for example, no perfumes, however you do that whatever the agreements are, for your practice, all this takes place prior to that first visit. And then there is the first visit. And what do you do stuff that you're also familiar with. The first thing you're going to do, of course, is you're going to review the initial questionnaire and I do so line item by line item and one of the features of the questionnaire that you have access to with the menopause method is there a summary page on there and what a wonderful tool that that will be, especially in the future, when you refer back to try and under understand what the core issues are that your patient has. And you also review all of her laboratory and imaging reports. And then there's the initial physical and female exam. And this can be done by yourself. pelvic exam, female exam for physical exam, or menopause medicine lends itself really well to woman's personal physician, doing her initial exams and our annual exams, in any intervening medical exams, attending to other medical issues, however you want to do it, there is the initial and the annual physical and female exam. And then during that first visit, after you reviewed all the laboratory and imaging reports, you want to fill in the blanks, perhaps there's some testing that in addition to what the patient shows you at that first visit, and some women show up at that first visit with very extensive and beautiful laboratory results. And that's why I always wait for that first visit, I do not send out pre requisitions because they may already own and have had recent excellent testing and imaging reports. But at that first visit, if there's some things that are left out, and the most common things that are left out for me, is the very thorough thyroid screens that I like to do. And I'll define those for you later. And also, I always get an sh BG for reasons that are going to become very apparent for you as we go on and initial FSH and LH and I'll explain why. So very often, if they don't show up with those specific items that I like to have, it's at that first visit that I'll write the requisitions or will draw their blood and fasting blood and another time in our office, whatever it takes to fill in the details of the laboratory testing that you want. And then I always like to address the subject of risk with my patients because

one thing I discovered early on is whether it's overt or or Not really revealed, almost every single woman that has walked into my office other than those who have pre read my book is they have concern about is there a risk and taking these hormones. And you don't have to give them the whole explanation. They are looking to you to your authority, though, as to what you consider to be the truth about that. And so we have an extensive section on risks and benefits, and that we think will really help shore you up if you haven't investigated this field very deeply, so that you know, in your heart and your backbone that this is a good thing for them. And a little discussion doesn't have to be lengthy about risks, and they can feel where you stand on it. And you can answer any questions there. I think it's so important because I just don't want a situation where a woman is rubbing hormones on her skin once or twice a day. And every time she does so, it's a reminder that She's frightened about will this cause cancer or something, we want to put her mind as much to ease and rest and we can do so. From the actual medical literature and from how the human body and illness behaves, we can do them a great favour by putting their fears to rest. We can't guarantee that none of us are at risk in a way. But we can sure show the benefits in the less risk that a woman is at by being treated with bioidentical hormones rather than no treatment at all. So again, I'll go into detail of that and further video
