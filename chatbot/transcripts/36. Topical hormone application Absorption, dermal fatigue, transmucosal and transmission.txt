As far as the transdermal oestrogen is gonna absorption in the beginning of the treatment protocol during the phase of alleviating symptoms. And I've already mentioned this to you apply the oestrogen to the soft skin or the inner forearms. And once symptoms are well alleviated, move application to additional sites, and you rotate these sites and over time and consulting with your patients regarding their programme, be cognizant that their possible skin absorption issues can develop poor absorption, otherwise known as dermal fatigue, how we did discover that they'll start at developing symptoms of insufficiency, or you'll notice it on hormone test. Because the menopause method includes doing an annual 24 hour urine hormone test, you'll learn a lot, you're going to see changes that are going to need to be made over time. And that's where you're going to pick up absorption issues. And then we also recommend that you keep skin sites exclusive to the hormone that you're choosing, for example, use the soft forearms exclusively for biassed. And then these other application sites that we've delineated keep them exclusive for progesterone, the sites that we mentioned their bias for the sites that we mentioned there. And there's reasons for this. I'm not going to go into the details right now but keep the chosen application sites to be exclusive for a specific hormone. And we're going to use other sites for testosterone and even DHEA. Here's Dr. Wright again weighing in. On wood again, I'm emphasising is a very important thing. And he's saying don't become a victim of the all too common errors in BioIdentical Hormone Replacement Therapy. fundamental error number two, never taking a monthly break. We are strong believers in the monthly break for reasons that I think I've explained so that you can understand it. And I mean, for one thing is Dr. Wright points out that continuous combined estrogens and hormone regimens, so including prempro, for example, confer to 43% greater risk for breast cancer than sequential regimens where they're stoppage once a month. This is why we want the monthly break. And there it is continuous combined regimens confer to 43% greater risk for breast cancer, I'm happy to repeat that because we want that and once a month stoppage, and you can just with a little imagination, you can see how you could bio accumulate hormones over time, if you just kept on with everything without ever stopping. If you are applying one molecule of overdose, eventually you accumulate more than is optimal. And there it is, take a break from hormone treatment once a month. And this is an extract from my book. Let's see if I want to read this. It's kind of fun. First woman at the top is saying is that 1/8 teaspoon in the morning or a pill in the evening and second woman or is it one quarter in the morning and 1/8 at night, or one quarter of 1/8 with a 15 milligramme Nightcap? Or I think I have to apply it on day three or eight? Or was it on my forehead? Or is it on my 45th birthday. There's a woman at the bottom saying I think I'm going to need to enrol in medical school and the other woman says it's hard to believe that our faces look so similar. And our doses could be so different. This is the meanderings of a dear beloved office manager and I and he was so much a part of the first edition of the book on menopause. We're now in the sixth edition of it. And there's more information about application in the appendix. I'm not going to do a video presentation of the information in the appendix but there's some good resources for their, for their for you to refer to. And here's an article on dermal absorption fatigue first described as far as I know by Dr. Wright, and how he approaches this is over several years of time, many women using transdermal oestrogen preparations have progressively lower urinary oestrogen levels. Sometimes these lower levels are reflected in symptoms, but sometimes particularly in women who have used bioidentical hormone regimens, replacement for longer periods of time, there are no symptoms of these lower oestrogen levels. And as I walked you through the consequences of low hormone levels, we know that it's extremely important. From my perspective, that that does not occur. Dr. Wright coined the term dermal absorption fatigue. And he's gone so far as to recommend transmucosal application of these hormones that have specific challenges all of their own, and I'll tell you about them as we proceed here. The possible remedies for dermal absorption fatigue, well, there's possible application to the mucosal surfaces such as the trans preantral mucosal application, and then translational or trans vaginal application. Well, these are terrific absorptive surfaces. But for women who are having intercourse, I wouldn't apply oestrogen there I would consider Applying progesterone there, although progesterone for men every day, or however frequently intercourse is and of course that is part of the fact what you factor in to whether progesterone application intervention is okay when you're having intercourse. Now transcranial mucosa, that's fine for women who are not having intercourse. The vagina and the labia are excellent places to apply the hormones. However, when you go to do the test, there is a caveat for that. So I want to illustrate that for you. I had a patient in her early 40s, who had a premature onset of menopause. And when she first came to me by that time, she had severe vaginal atrophy, and the concomitant irritation that urethral meatus. So I did what we commonly do. I started around my usual transdermal dosages, and then for one tubes worth of a vaginal estriol, a hormone application, and for the first couple of months, she would apply nightly, a half a millilitre of this vaginal estriol preparation. And that was fine. And then she's stabilised and symptom relief. And we were both cognizant of that it had become time to test her. And so she being a good scientist that she was certainly scientifically oriented. She said, Well, is there any problem with me doing the vaginal estriol? And I said, well, good point, there could be. And we consulted with laboratory director and he recommended ceasing the vaginal estriol application for 48 hours, thinking that would be ample time for the vagina to absorb any residual estradiol. And my patient being the good scientists that she wrote she omitted the vaginal estriol for 60 hours in one of the things that we found is that her 24 year and hormone test results showed an extremely high estriol obviously contamination, the urine, passing out the urethra muitas part of the vagina that had received the STR was still after 60 hours still having lingering estriol in it. So this is the caveat. If you are going to do 24 hour urine hormone testing within the menopause method, this is the way to go. Absolutely. It's one of most important tool that you can possibly bring to the long term safety of the women you're working with. And there is no substitute for it. And you'll hear me say it over and over again. And so you can switch to transparency and on the Cosa application. For example, if you're applying biassed into vaginally, and then because I have shied away from this, I don't know the length of time you have to do that. Or you could bypass the vagina entirely and apply it to the external periodontal mucosa. And there's more data on this of the actual testing we did with this woman. But vaginal estriol could be transmitted in intercourse Of course, there's no concern if there is no intercourse, and it could interfere with urine hormone testing the remedy transparent no mucosa application at least or during the urine collection now are you going to get the exact same absorption? No, but you're gonna have a good idea around ballpark. And as far as measuring devices for trans Perenial or trans label or trans vaginal application? Well, it turns out that these oil bottles, they work just fine. So if you're applying progesterone to the vagina, the very same suspension that you use for transdermal progesterone, you can apply to the vagina, although we suggest that you begin with less because you probably titrated up to six drops of transdermal progesterone before you decided that this was probably not sufficient. So I would start with two drops out of the progesterone dispensing and biassed the 30 milligramme familiar that's four tenths of a milligramme of extra equivalent per drop. You can also apply that trans vaginally as well. And of course the can be made in stronger strengths. And to get helpful start on the vagina and the healing of an atrophic vagina you could apply bias directly to the vagina the very same bias that you're applying to your skin. Now, other measuring devices have been devised for administering these smaller volumes. And for example, a one millilitre syringe, which has increments of 1/10 of a millilitre or less you can give increments of dosage. So for this we would recommend that if you're going to use a different medium, such as biassed and carbopol or some cream, that you make a 15 milligramme per millilitre at 20 and that's going to be 4.5 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per millilitre, thus in 1/10 of a millilitre, which is an easy amount to and small amount to administer. You got about half per milligramme of estradiol equivalent, or you can make it weaker, I mean, you're the ones who choosing the string theory, you can make a 10 milligramme per millilitre. Thus, each administration of a 10th of a millimetre would be three tenths of a milligramme of estradiol equivalent. Now, the question I've already given a brief hint about this can transdermal is be transmitted to a spouse and others by contact? Yes, if you apply bias tears, to your skin, to your forearms, and you immediately go up and hug your spouse, you will transmit them hormones. But we have done experiments with this. And these experiences, the results of these experiments are in our appendix, and you're not going to transfer a lot, even if you do it immediately. And washing the skin works if you decide you've applied your hormones and then you decide to have intimate contact, you can immediately wash the skin and you'll you'll remove you will not transmit anything to your spouse. Or even if you wait for a half hour 95% of the dose has been absorbed. We know this by the experiments that we've done. And you'll see those in the appendix. Now, one time we were a question was raised by a research pharmacologist, his I was treating his wife, and she was applying hormones transdermally. And he was involved in the original Cyril birth control pill development. And one thing they learned was these hormones are immortal, and they're everywhere. And of course, they were working with them in powdered form. And so they were in the air conditioning ducts. And one thing that really concerned him how easy these things were to transmit and how long they lasted. And his wife and his daughter shared clothing, and often shared bedding without pyjamas on. So he was a little concerned that his teenage daughter was going to get some of this and they will. But you know, these are very unusual situations. And we've done research and so if you have recently applied the biassed theories of your skin that can touch a partner and you want to have contact with that partner, you can wash the skin well, contact will be safe, no transmission. I've

already said this. And if you have touch someone soon after application of the hormones, and are concerned about possible transmission, they can wash and that'll make it disappear immediately. They'll probably get a little bit of absorption. But you know, these little slips, they're no big deal. But if it happened every single day twice a day with biassed to apply the bias then you immediately hug your partner. Now that would be a different circumstance. So we're talking again, how do we keep the risk as close to zero as possible? We pay attention to these details.
