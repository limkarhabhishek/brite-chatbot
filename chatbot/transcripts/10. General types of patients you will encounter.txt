I'd like to take a look at a few examples of the actual patients you could encounter. For example, here is a 38 year old woman and basically good health, and she's having an occasional irregular periods. And when she does have these irregular periods, she has mild anxiety. Could that be from insufficient progesterone, and she might have breast tenderness and PMS, again, out of balance, where the oestrogen is dominating the effects of progesterone. And I like to recall what I thought to be the seminal graph of showing that earlier, and more substantial decline that can happen with progesterone very early on a woman in her mid 30s. This can start happening, where the progesterone is less, and the oestrogen effects dominate the progesterone. The progesterone decline is a curling earlier, and more profoundly than the decline of oestrogen. And I tell you, if you can identify and treat this early progesterone decline, we can do great good. It's one of the frontiers of treating women get that progesterone in early for a lot of reasons that you'll understand more when I talk in depth about progesterone. So if you have a 35 year old woman coming to you, for whatever she is coming to you stop and think of her hormonal balance. For example, let's say she's coming to you for weight issues or for whatever. Look for possible progesterone deficiency. If it's about weight, for example, progesterone even relates to thyroid function. I mean, why does a woman's temperature go up? midcycle is a way to check for ovulation. Because if she has ovulated, her progesterone skyrockets and progesterone is needed for the adequate function of thyroid hormone. How wild is that? And what does thyroid animate metabolism. So if you get the optimal amount of thyroid function, as occurs when you get that progesterone output, your temperature goes up, because your metabolism is increased, increased heat, rather amazing. And of course, it's possible to consider other issues as well. No matter what she's coming, diabetes, whatever it is fatigue, look at those hormonal issues and think about this progesterone. Let's take another patient. Here's a 45 year old woman, she's used to having clockwork 28 day cycles, and now she's getting anywhere from 22 to 35 days cycles, about every three months, regular for a couple months. But about every three months, she's got one of these irregular cycles. And when she does, she has trouble falling asleep. Occasional panic attacks. Remember how I opened all this up with the patient to change the course of my medical career in my life with Deborah who thought she was going insane. You might be thinking along the lines of that dramatic change in a healthy functioning woman. And then this woman can also have sore breasts and sore nipples when she's having one of these irregular cycles. Well, let's take a look at what could be going on here. How about no ovulation the progesterone is flatline. So this the oestrogen dominance is far more prevalent and far more pronounced. There it is. oestrogen dominance. Progesterone is way low, just a tiny amount coming out of the adrenal gland comparatively, and the oestrogen is way prevailing over the effects of progesterone. And when she does, she has trouble falling asleep with occasional panic attacks. Well, that's a symptom of way low progesterone. The great calmer progesterone is one of the hormones it's really needed for a woman to sleep well. So her breasts and nipples, there's the oestrogen dominant effect. And this is more severe than that quote earlier and more pronounced decline of progesterone that takes place when ovulation does not occur, is far more pronounced. This is all but the total drop out of progesterone. So progesterone decline is precip precipitously with a cessation of ovulation. Let's look at another patient. Here's a 50 year old woman who used to have 28 Day clockwork cycles as so many women have. And now she's getting a radically time cycles anywhere from 22 to 35 days, and she's having hot flashes and breast tenderness, hot flashes and breast tenderness among other symptoms. Well, let's look at what could be happening here. Here's the classic oestrogen curve, but what happens in the perimenopause with oestrogen. It can be variable in its output. It's not that lovely classic regular curve that we see in so many young women starts getting irregular because pituitary hormones in the ovary are starting to do a dance of the brain and the pituitary is asking what's going on here. We seem to be having declining hormonal output. And so it can even look this erratic. This is very common in the menopause where women are going lower than they ever have. And they can even have some peaks that have gone higher as the pituitary starts digging the ovary, so to speak, to hey, listen, you can't drop that low. We got to produce more hormones. And this goes on for a while this ping pong thing. Overall, the amount of oestrogen that's being produced over that month is less, even though there's some higher peaks. And that's why this woman is having hot flashes. So you can wind up having symptoms of both hot flashes, which is oestrogen deficiency, and breast tenderness. When there's oestrogen dominance, this can all occur in the same cycle. And this woman could benefit from both oestrogen and progesterone in our treatment plan. Let's look at an older patient. This is a 53 year old with no menses times 16 months and those of you who get interested in menopause, you're going to see a lot of these women because often, they'll tend to tolerate the early menopausal changes and think, Well, it's all part of life. But sometimes these early change, these changes get so intense, that they might have waited a while like this woman 16 months who waited to come to see you but eventually they started not being able to function properly with the amount of debilitation, such as anxiety and trouble falling asleep. That can be from way low progesterone and hot flashes and night sweat in a racing mind at night. You wake up in the middle of the night and you can't fall back asleep. They can also have vaginal dryness and pain on intercourse and cystitis because of what's taking place in the vagina from that vaginal atrophy. These are all symptoms of insufficient oestrogen. This time the menopausal situation, these ovaries have gone quiet. Now you can have a variable amount of oestrogen because testosterone can be converted aromatize to oestrogen in a woman's adipose tissue. Which is interesting because the women who do that, ie the women who have significant amount of adipose tissue, sometimes they're not having the raucous symptoms of menopause, because they've got sufficient oestrogen, not to menstruate, but to not have some of these symptoms. So you're also going to have minimal progesterone coming out of the adrenal glands. And more that when we get into the biochemistry, you'll see how this is operative in but not enough to make a difference at all. So there's another type of decline I'd like you to look at, because when a woman enters menopause, which I've labelled there the onset of menopause. Well, her estrogens are at a certain level and they're on the decline, these hormones continue to decline. So if you were to test a woman at the onset of menopause, you're gonna see some oestrogen there that over time is not gonna sustain. And when you start examining, doing 24 hour urine hormone tests on older women, you're gonna see that these levels get so low. Why do I want to point that out? Because that's so not okay. They have super low levels of these hormones. The androgens also declined. Now, they can do something a little unusual because you're getting quite an Andrew production, also out of the adrenal glands, and so they might not as a woman enters menopause, be the first to decline. They may even keep steady for a while a year or two even or some women actually enter menopause, they get the declining oestrogen and progesterone and they wind up getting a little elevation, a little bump in the engines because that's how a woman's body can compensate for those low estrogens. They can convert testosterone and DHEA into estrogens. But I want to tell you, it will not last. I have yet to see a woman that goes 234 years with adequate androgens and these androgens are as crucial as any hormone that we've got in our body. So we're gonna have a lot more to say about that. And then there's going to be a certain percentage of women that those antigens have already started to decline very early in menopause. Because endogenous work lovely for the stress response, they'll

double up and contribute to the fight or flight biochemistry. And so a lot of women are entering perimenopause and menopause with quite depleted androgens. It's very significant. So what am I pointing out here? Lots of different possibilities, lots of different variations, no matter. You just individualise it for each individual woman that shows up. That's what it calls for. To review the kind of balances that you can have, let's say between the oestrogen and progesterone. Here's an example of a woman who's got adequate oestrogen, adequate progesterone, and they're balanced and she's menstruating and ovulating. In fact, this woman is also menstruating and ovulating, but I'm just reviewing. Here we have the predominance of oestrogen over progesterone. And another variation where a woman has oestrogen lean, but progesterone rich, and another variation where a woman is producing adequate oestrogen, but her progesterone started to decline, even below normal ranges, but she can still menstruate. But she's there come a point where she's not ovulating. And this would be this woman, because all you need is the oestrogen to menstruate to form that endometrial lining. You don't need the progesterone for that. And here, obviously, we're getting into the older ages. And this is an example of where that progesterone is declining earlier and more profoundly. And then you get into a situation where a woman is menstruating and she's not ovulating, her progesterone is quite significantly dropped. And now we're moving into true menopause where a woman's not menstruating and not ovulating. And there's a couple of variations of that where you can have more substantial oestrogen and usually a woman who's overweight and has got adequate adipose tissue to transform testosterone into oestrogen. And then you've got women who are thin. And these these women tend to be thinner. The ones who have the very low estrogens because they don't they're not converting much in their adipose tissue because they don't have much any one of these times. Oh my a terrific time for you to identify this lowest progesterone and even low progesterone and treat with progesterone at a minimum
