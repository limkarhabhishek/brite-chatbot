And what's in this stuff? Well, I originally began treating with armour, desiccated thyroid, I mean, in my mind, somehow it was natural. And then I went through this time of being a little concerned about armour, but to back up a little bit one grain of Armour has, which is 60 milligrammes or you know, it's a little more a grain is an old pharmaceutical term, it's I think it's 62 or 64. milligrammes actually it provides 38 micrograms of T four and nine micrograms of T three, and you can do the math for the rest of this. So when you're converting thyroid doses consider that for example, 100 micrograms of T four is roughly equivalent to 25 micrograms of T three or one grain of armour. So 100 micrograms is Synthroid that's two of the 50 micrograms, is equivalent to about one grain which is 60 milligrammes of armour, and of course, that's going to vary patient, a patient and how they metabolise it, but it's a rough conversion, for you to use and so, but the initial dose because when I convert and there's HalfLife differences, but when I convert, I have someone stop taking what they're taking per day or two or three, just to drain a little bit, and then start back up with half a grain or 30 milligrammes if I'm switching from Synthroid or voxel or something to armour or vice versa. I'll start with 50 micrograms, no matter what they're on pretty much of the desiccated thyroid. And then one day, things sort of change for me, a patient of mine brought in their bottle of Armour Thyroid, and they said, Did you ever smell this? And I never had an oh my god, you open that up, and it has such a strong odour of the barnyard. And it got me thinking and it was coincident with a time when there was mad cow disease. And I knew very well how husbandry of animals was going in the United States. I spent most of my adult life in the West kind of Western states in the southwestern United States. And there was these cow concentration camps all over the place, and they were really appalling. And you know, they these were not free roaming and beautiful pasture cows. They're sitting inside of these iron fence enclosures with only dirt that they're walking around in and manure, and they pile the manure and the cows walk them into manure piles in the stench is atrocious. And no wonder these cows are not well, and they have to be treated with antibiotics and they're given steroids. And it's appalling. And so, you know, a lot of times people get sick from sick animals and I wasn't making the direct connection to Jakob kreiss Felder, mad cow disease, but I thought, why would I be giving patients something that came from American agribusiness farms? And so I want to shy away I know evidence, pharmacists assured me to the best they can, that there was no disease transmission occurring in armour, but hey, I knew that Synthroid levoxyl Even though with his name, Synthroid happened to be bio identical with a few additives, of course, including in actual Synthroid lactose. I started switching people to T four, and then because it was testing, I also knew when I had to switch them over to add in long acting T three, or even pure T three. And so I made the switch, desiccated thyroid has a ratio just so that you know what you're working with there is there's a greater amount of T three than there is an actual human thyroid, but that's hardly consequential. I mean, really, you're titrating dosages you're dose determining and, you know, people wind up for well being and you know, there is a certain percentage that feel better on armour, and then there's a certain percentage that feel better on on Synthroid, and or Synthroid plus long acting. So I moved most of my practice over the years over as best I could to pure tea for levothyroxine and log back in T three, and then I still have a few patients Under Armour because when we tried to switch them over to the bioidentical levothyroxine, they didn't do as well, even with levothyroxine in long acting T three. So don't want to blur the issue for you. The bottom line is, you have a lot of folks who are functionally hypothyroid. That means their tests and blood tests are gonna look pretty good. Although when you zero in on them microscopically, you're gonna see oh, wait a minute here. These subtleties that I've been illustrating on the screen. These aren't youthful levels and maybe their tiredness and their constipation and dry skin has something to do with low thyroid. Let's do a trial. And it's very reliable because if you start giving someone thyroid And no matter what your treatment management and they feel better, and they don't get rapid pulse, etc, and then you test them three weeks later. And their test numbers come in more useful appearing, it's not rocket science. And that's what I want to emphasise to you, I'm giving you a lot of detail. I love the background, it's been very helpful to me, I've sought after the background. And yet, what it comes down to is no big deal. You're trying to assess people hormone levels, and the chances are that they've got some mileage on them, the people like 4050 60,000 miles so to speak. They're going to be low in hormones, because they're using those hormones way too excessively, to augment their fight or flight biology, which they've learned how to trigger inside themselves, they didn't learn it. It's been genetically passed down for generations. And they're, they're having a dysfunctional or excessive response to stress, and they're over taxing their glands. And eventually, those glands can't keep up with the output demands. So, bottom line is people are depleted in hormones, and they're unbalanced in hormones. And so you're identifying it and you're replenishing the hormones, you're bringing them up to decent levels. And that's a big deal. Because this isn't like taking a B vitamins. You know, some people actually feel by B vitamins in a lot of people don't are taking Kokyu. So sometimes people feel cute, don't really take it, but a lot of people don't feel they're taking a handful of vitamins, they can't do anything that isn't true about the world of hormones, these are far more potent biochemicals that people miss, they make a big difference for people. And that's why you and I are here, right? Because you know, that uses back that. So the consequences of helping someone replenish into decent hormone levels are very impactful. And of course, I'm a major advocate of nutritional supplements and good diet. Absolutely. And, but at the same time, these are far more potent. It's an art to get them right. And it's a miracle to restore them to decency, and people feel that and they love it when you get it right. So we're just bringing thyroid into the fold, because they all most everything depletes during the overuse of the biological stress response. It's not like you're just gonna get a select depletion of estradiol, or a select version of DHEA. No way they all mobilise during the fight or flight response. That's what the amazing thing is, you get a lot of powerful biochemical circulating and you if you need to flee from that Sabre toothed Tiger, or you're worried about your cash flow, or whatever it is you're worried about. So I wanted to point out here that in this description straight out of the PDR, or the witnesses online, I remember they say that it's a natural preparation derived from poor sign thyroid glands, and has a strong characteristic odour. Yes, it has a strong characteristic odour, smell it sometime and see how much you want to prescribe this to people. And then you know, look at pig husbandry and cow husbandry. It's for in large measure, it's just really appalling. And this is what these are derived from, and then there is that odour and then it's not like the Synthroid and the low voxel are perfectly innocent. They got some problems in it, like take a look at those Synthroid ingredients. COVID owners, I mentioned lactose, I mean, you've got you've got people with very significant lactose intolerance. And then they're also adding varying food colorings and talc to this. So it's not like there's the perfect solution for this and I think compounders can get more pure and have gotten more pure, because the environmentally sensitive folks, a lot of men can't tolerate anything that's untoward. And so we can get there and the white label thyroxin is the least offensive in these are the ingredients of it. And this is generic
