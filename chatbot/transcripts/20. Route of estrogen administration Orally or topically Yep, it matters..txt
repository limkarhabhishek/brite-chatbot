Let's look at the route of administration. I assert that there's a right oestrogen route, you could apply to the skin through compounded organic oils or other bases, such as gels and creams. There are new pharmaceutical products. There's transmucosal preparations of estriol bias progesterone, testosterone and DHEA. There's trans labelled trans, vaginal, trans external periodontal mucosa. Very useful. The pharmaceutical industry has produced these patches, the dermal patch is in one sense bio identical, but it is only an extra dial. And then there's the various strengths. Look at those numbers there. There's a lot of decimal points there. Because they handle this different than the way we talk about transdermal application. This is not the amount of estradiol for example that's applied to the skin. This is amount that's delivered into the body. So there's ways to correlate this with mounts applied to the skin. That's a subject we'll get into it. How about the sublingual preparations? Well, they certainly exist for biotin estradiol, but I'm going to say no on those because when you're taking a sublingual preparation, there's only a certain amount of it goes through the oral mucosa. Some amount of it is swallowed. And that's not the best. Again, we're aiming for the very best, is I'll point out to you soon, that the oral estrogens are not the way to go. And how about oral estrogens? The most popular way that women have been receiving estrogens forever, including Premarin and including estradiol valerate that I mentioned there. There are safety issues with World administration. And so in trying to design a system that is thorough enough, and the checks off the checklist to reduce the risk is as close to zero as we can get it. Although millions of women have tolerated oral estrogens, it's not the best. And there are safety issues with them. Well, let's look at what happens when you swallow. A steroid hormones such as oestrogen orally, goes into the gut passes through the gut was absorbed through the gut wall and goes immediately Well, some of its metabolised in the gut, well wall, some of it actually didn't get absorbed and goes out the faeces. But the majority of it goes to the portal vein and goes directly to the liver. And what happens in the liver is a certain amount of it is metabolised. Right then in there, this can be 5080 90 95% metabolised right away of the dose that you gave, and then there is a certain amount of it that makes it through without being metabolised in it excreted and that's the bioavailable hormone that comes from an oral dose and those can be reabsorbed. I'm sorry, there'll be picked up again by the liver ultimately to be metabolised. If they made it through first pass, they're going to eventually be make it to the liver to be metabolised to be excreted. Well, 30 to 60% of the oral dose that you took as metabolised, becomes metabolites in the bioavailable hormones are way down, and the dose has to be considerably robust. To get a significant amount of bioavailable hormones. The outcome of first pass is the metabolite levels are remarkably elevated, we'll have a lot to say about metabolites and the bioavailable hormone levels are reduced and the higher the oral dosage is required to achieve adequate plasma concentration of hormones orally. Here's hormone replacement therapy and article on this and breast density changes conclusion. transdermal HRT use is associated with a significantly lower incidence of increased mammographic breast density and breast tenderness compared with oral HRT. Here's an article are all estrogens created equal. It's a review of oral versus transdermal therapy. And the review article says that significant differences appear to exist between oral and transdermal estrogens, bypassing hepatic metabolism transdermal hormone therapy appears to result in more stable serum estradiol levels without the super physiological concentrations within the liver, and they may have a less pronounced effect on hepatic protein synthesis, such as inflammatory markers. This is one of the consequences of taking estrogens orally, you get an increase in the inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein, and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Yeah, coagulation. Increased coagulation with oral oestrogen. You know, just to pause for a moment. When we think of a heart attack, we tend to think it's all about atherosclerosis. Well, the actual death is all about the clot in most every instance, that forms on the roughened arterioles sclerotic surface which is a perfect notice to form a clot So coagulation becomes a major issue for people as they grow older and are more apt to have arterial sclerosis and oral estrogens increase the markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. And they also increase the steroid binding proteins such as sh PG, which lowers testosterone availability and thus lowers libido. coagulation issues matter remembering women's age adjusted mortality rates from heart disease are four to six times higher than their mortality rates from breast cancer. And the main issue with the Escal erotic coronary arteries, as I just mentioned, is that they are a night is for a clot and you can learn more about this in the appendix back to first pass, let me illustrate 24 hour urine hormone testing instructions. This is how we're told to for women to collect their urine, quote, take all hormones you are using before and during the 24 hour urine Hmong collection period. Absolutely, it's fantastic. We get a real time reading of how these hormones are being taken into the body and what their levels are in the body. That's one of the tremendous advantages of 24 hour urine hormone collections. However, there's an exception in the instructions that commonly say if you're taking hormones orally omit taking them the night prior to the beginning of urine collection. Plus during the urine collection period. I wondered about that for years until I finally learned what it was about. Because if you give oral doses, you're gonna wind up with very significant levels on the 24 hour urine. So let me give you an example of a 55 year old white female she was thin, she was severely symptomatic, and she had prior failures with transdermal hormones, the patch, vaginal and anal application. Well, let's look at the preparation. And let's look at progesterone in the route in this case is transdermal and the milligramme she was taking at bedtime was 38 milligrammes and then she switched to a different way she was took it by mouth, and as she followed the directions, she omitted the progesterone capsules the night prior to the collection, but in this case, the woman did not follow directions, she took them during the collection, she took 75 milligrammes about twice as much as the transdermal route. Well, here's the 24 hour urine hormone results and we measure progesterone by its principal metabolite, pregnant and dial because progesterone is so efficiently metabolised in the body that the vapour trails the pregnant dials does tell us about how much is making it into the body. Well, this is an expected pregnancy dial level, from 38 milligrammes of transdermal progesterone in the reference range for young women is springing down somewhere between 750 and 1500. It can go higher than that. And then this was the result of pregnancy dial micrograms for 24 hours 9565.

And when you think about it, the oral progesterone dosage is 95 to 90%. Administered goes through first pass, the pregnant dial is approximately 15 to 25% derived from the circulating progesterone, which is not first pass. My point here is she did follow instructions that are omitted a night before but she took them to progesterone capsules, 75 milligrammes not a high dose, and she got a tremendously high pregnant dal level they are approaching pregnancy levels, not the upper limit, which is about wrong in the 3000s for a young menstruating woman mid luteal. Now, I've already spoken about this woman, let's look at her estrogens, we first started treating with bias and we did the transdermal route and milligrammes of estradiol equivalent of bias that she was taking was 2.3 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent is a way to define the potency of the bias formulation, which has a real pote the most potent oestrogen and estradiol and estriol, which is an eighth of the potency of estradiol, so I'll tell you a lot more about milligrammes of estradiol equivalent as we go on. Now, I want to talk about the estrogens that we gave this particular woman, and the preparation we started off with was biassed, and the route was transdermal and the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per 24 hours. And this is a way that we measure oestrogen potency when we administer it in the form of bias, and I have a lot more to say about that. But it was within the reference range of the common amount that women use a 2.3 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, and then we switch this woman to Astra dial Po, this is very early on in my career is taking it orally. And I had wanted to do this different than the instruction set on the 24 hour urine. I asked her to take the estradiol the night before, and during the 24 hour urine hormone collection because I wanted to see what was really happening in real time rather than just omitting it and she took a rather substantial dose there that she had dose determined to live aviator symptoms at four milligrammes and now let's look at the 24 hour urine hormone test and what we evaluate first is the total potent estrogens. This is the sum of estradiol the most potent oestrogen and s drone 80% is potent is the estradiol. I like to add those up. And also we got the oestrogen quotient on that just to look at the estrogens, the total potent estrogens added up to 3.3. That's quite low. My preferred range is between eight and 14 micrograms for 24 hours. And this is why we switched her to estradiol, orally just as a trial back in the day. That's the reference range. We'd like to see a woman come in between those goalposts and she had what was considered to be a very beneficial oestrogen quotient out of bias, which we expect that's why we use bias one of the main reasons, somewhere between two and four. Now get ready for crazy when we're looking at the RLs to dial the total potent estrogens added up to over 1000. Remember, the upper limit of normal of acceptability is 14. And she had circulating estrogens in her body as she dial plus s drone adding up to 1081 and the oestrogen quotient with pure estradiol and we'll get into the oestrogen quotient. But just to illustrate it for you, how did his oestrogen quotient which is unsatisfactory and unacceptable is 0.1. And this prompted a letter from the laboratory saying, doctor, your patient is receiving very substantial over the top doses of estrogens from a laboratory. Wow, lesson learned oral Ester doubt astounding the amount of levels and here's an article by Dr. Jonathan Wright, about increased hormone and metabolite issues with oral estrogens. And what he's concluding here is the previously recommended oral dose of estradiol of one to two milligrammes a day results in urinary excretion of estrone had values five to 10 times the upper limit of normal of the reference range for pre menopausal women. And retrospective studies, associating oral estradiol with increased risk of breast cancer may actually reflect overdose conditions. So the increased risk with oral estrogens could relate to just overdosing women. And my goodness, I sure found that to be the case. I remember one exemplary patient. She came to me at the age of 60, wanting to switch to bioidenticals. She hadn't been on Premarin, since she went into menopause at 40 and her doctor put her on Premarin. And she had never had breast tenderness a day in her life, until she was put on Premarin. And then she had 20 years of breast tenderness and never questioned it. And that wasn't from the Premarin. It was from an overdose. You know, back in the day when people were learning about these and not checking in very carefully, obviously, to a woman who had over stimulation of her breast glandular tissue, enough to have breast tenderness for 20 years. So based on our current knowledge, a prudent dose ceiling for oral if it's ever to be used, estradiol replacement therapy would be 0.25 milligrammes a day, a quarter to an eighth of what's currently recommended. Now, I know for certain that Dr. Wright does not prescribe oral progesterone, but he was trying to help our traditional colleagues who are still using oral estrogens, and at least get that dose, right. So they're not producing excessive amounts of estradiol and estrone in their urine. And, you know, ever since that day, you never say never, I had one woman in her late 80s and oral estradiol because she just couldn't manage the transdermal because of severe cognitive decline. She could manage the oral so you never say never, but I'm gonna say close to never treat a woman with oral estrogens. It's totally unnecessary because the trans journals and transmucosal is they absorb beautifully. Let's look at another resource. This is a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology doctrine Buster, and he's talking about the transdermal versus oral estrogens. And he says that since there is no first pass liver deactivation of transdermal estradiol, effective doses is that can be used or small first pass metabolism of oral estradiol is associated with adverse events, traditionally attributed to menopausal hormone therapy. No, it's the first pass Dr. Buster is saying the first pass significantly impairs bioavailability of oral estradiol. large doses are required to overcome first pass, and they induce super physiologic release of hepatic proteins including C reactive protein, inflammation, insulin like growth factor, one clotting factors hormone binding globulin for example, sex hormone binding globulin, ZZ, you'll see what a problem they can be increasing thyroxin binding globulin and cortisol binding globulin, Dr. Buster telling us the effects of first pass first pass impacts adversely on lipids, cardiovascular functions, inflammatory and thrombotic mechanisms insulin resistance and weight control, and it may aggravate the metabolic syndrome. This is a traditional gynaecologist talking about the use of oral estradiol. And here's the effects of compounded bioidentical transdermal hormone therapy and hemostatic, inflammatory and immune factors. The essence of this article is that the therapy of biassed which is 80%. estriol is what they used and 20% estradiol and or progesterone for eight weeks, the cardiovascular biomarkers, inflammatory factors, immune signalling factors and health outcomes were favourably impacted despite very high levels of stress in this particular patient population, and home and work strain in the study subjects. And then here's an article by Dr. Wright don't become a victim of all too common errors in BioIdentical Hormone Replacement Therapy. This is fundamental error number one, swallowing oestrogen by Dr. Wright, first published in the Townsend letter in December of 2013. So there turns out to be when all is said and done a right oestrogen route and that right route is transdermal or transmucosal and not oral
