topic I want to consider, one might consider it a side road to the whole subject of menopause. But I'd like to address it because I think it is in the purview of menopause. Because if women can develop arterial sclerosis and also come to an equal risk level as men by the age of their 60, in a lot of patients, you're going to see they have gone years without adequate hormones. And they could be developing some arterial sporadic issues that may result from that I'm not saying it's a one on one correlation. But hey, there's I've already given you evidence in the medical literature, of how these ovarian hormones can be a very significant benefit in preventing of arterial sclerosis. It's one of the reasons why you very rarely hear of a young woman keeling over on a tennis court have a heart attack, but it does occur from time to time or a man in his 40s will pass away from a heart attack on a tennis court, or whatever. But the point that I'd like to make is these coronary issues, they proceed very slowly or atherosclerosis of even the coronary arteries is a very slow moving train. And that's not what gives the people the greatest immediate problem, because collateral circulation develops. And what gives people the problems when they have arterial sclerosis, is the clot that can form on the arterial sclerotic rough surface of the artery. And so coagulation becomes a very important thing for us to consider as all these aspirin takers and all the cardiologists who are prescribing some kind of, quote, blood thinner, in quote, some form of anticoagulant, it matters. I remember walking around a conference into the area of where the various companies are illustrating their their wares, and the various supplements and testing and it's a wonderful journey that I always like to take. And I ran into an all time favourite of mine, Gary Gordon, and we were discussing a patient who had coronary artery disease. And I wanted to hear the latest and greatest from one of these founders of intravenous chelation and extremely knowledgeable about a zillion topics. And Gary said to me in plain English, he said, Just remember, it's not the arteriosclerosis that gets these folks is that clot. So understand coagulation, test coagulation. And there's a lot of tools to deal with the specificities and complexities of coagulation issues. In fact, here's a report from one of the laboratories that has been bought up by this used to be an esoteric laboratory. In fact, their new name is esoteric is they were purchased by LabCorp. And they did some of the best work on very extensive and sophisticated coagulation studies. And they've got all kinds of panels and this is, this particular patient has a familial hypercholesterolemia that runs into the three hundreds and her father died of coronary artery disease, and I'm not so concerned about the hypercholesterolemia, I want to know particle size, stuff like that. And we won't go into that in this particular training session. The what I wanted to know most about her is does she have an increased propensity to clot. And especially since her father died of a stroke, ultimately, in the consequence of our junior sporadic heart disease, and here's a couple of the most common panels that they do that the it's called the iSeq. Panel, and it's coagulation only. And there's other there's familial patterns, and this woman had an elevated fibrinogen. And why does that happen often from inflammation, but some of the more sophisticated clotting factors, the she did not have those issues. And clotting is even when you show up and you're menopausal issues like if you in the history, you hear that a woman had trouble with the birth control pill, what kind of trouble I had thrombophlebitis had a pulmonary embolus do this long enough, you're gonna run across these patients. Why did that happen? Because usually of oral estrogens increases coagula ability. That's one of the reasons I never like to give estrogens orally, and I've only done it once. Again, our eyes on the prize. We're looking at the long term well being of our patients, and we want to evaluate any increased issues for possible quiet usability and I'm not doing this test on everyone. It's over $1,000 test, not only will you run into it with a potential possibility of a coronary artery clot, there's gonna be some women that you might be treating. And here's an example of two female patients in their 60s that we treated with both oestrogen and progesterone. And they both had events. One of them had some MRI evidence of mini strokes, the other did not and of course, I wondered, did we have anything to do with that by treatment, and I was only able to conclude, but of course, you want to be careful, while transdermal hormones do not increase the propensity to clot, whereas oral oestrogen does, but both of these had abnormal coagulation profiles, they had elevated fibrinogen and thrombin. And very often we're gonna see inflammation there, and possibly infection. You know, the clotting mechanism wasn't just to help people who got Javelin wounds, or spear wounds clot, so they could live was also to protect against the germs, it's a very primitive encapsulate the germ in a little clump of fibrinogen, and clot. So it's related to infection. So when you see these elevated fibrinogen, and thrombin, do you want to examined are they also they also have some of the common viruses, etc, that are definitely going to count as an infection. I realising I'm rushing through this, but I want to at least introduce you to it. So that you know and keep it in your awareness that some of these patients are going to be worth doing coagulation profiles on. And here's an example of two patients one was in her 70s, and the others was in early 50s. They both had legs thrombophlebitis. And they both responded. In other words, the thrombophlebitis disappeared by D seeing the progesterone. And again, what are the most common complications of the birth control pills that have estradiol and some kind of progestin in them? It was thrombophlebitis. So you'll find these folks and you know, some people, we just don't ask them to try and tolerate the progesterone. coagulation issues are possible. They're uncommon with hormones, but I wanted to at least add to your knowledge base and open your awareness to the possibility. And again, sophisticated coagulation studies are possible. And you know, you've got remedies. I mean, aspirin, for example, small dose of aspirin, or omega threes, oh, my goodness, I have patients that they can't take too much Omega three, they start bruising because they stopped coagulating as well. Yeah. And it's, it's wonderful. I mean, you can get a million miles on just omega threes, supplements and then there's also the more sophisticated supplements like Baluk and then if you have to go to heparin or you know, you go where you need to go, if you got people with coagulation issues. We've been on a long journey together. Oh, my goodness gracious. If you've made it this far, I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope it's valuable for you. I hope it translates into you being able to assist women in menopause with bioidentical hormones and all the accoutrements thereof. And you get to do an excellent job and be able to sleep well at night because you know, you're following a checklist that is bringing this down to is bringing that risk as close to zero as you can possibly get it. And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make. Thank you, everybody, and best wishes to you all.
