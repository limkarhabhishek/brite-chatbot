thyroid hormone receptors and reproduction. Oh yeah, that really does play a role. Oh, my goodness. I mean, thank goodness that there's so much better medicine being taken place because I remember that severe hypothyroidism was not uncommon and put a lot of infants into state institutions with hypothyroidism, otherwise known as cretinism. They in our medical school, they had us take a tour of one of those who was very impactful. Don't make a mistake around thyroid in the mothers during pregnancy are in the infants who can be born hypothyroid thyroid disorders have a great impact on fertility and both sexes, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism caused changes in sex hormone binding globulin, prolactin, gonadotropin releasing hormone and sex steroid serum levels. Whoa. That's powerful. In females, thyroid hormones may also have a direct effect on Oh sites, otherwise known as reproduction. And ovulation. Because it's known that specific binding sites for thyroxin are found on mouse and human Oh CITES. There is also an association between thyroid function and women and morbidity and outcome of pregnancy. Oh yeah. Pregnancy thyroid, man, every time we get the full panel, and when you thyroidism is restored, both abnormalities improved, or normalised in women. The alterations and fertility caused by thyroid disorders are more complex. Hyper and hypothyroidism are the main thyroid diseases that have an adverse effect on the female reproduction and cause menstrual disturbances, mainly hypomania, Polly Maria, in hyperthyroidism in algo, Maria in hypothyroidism, and you're going to see these women, how many women are going to show up to a physician or nurse practitioners office with menstrual irregularities. So why I'm emphasising This is bear in mind the thyroid gland, it isn't just the ovaries in recent studies that become evident that it is not only changes in serum levels of sh B, G, and SEC steroids, both of them. So we always measure it as HPG that are responsible for these disorders, but also alterations in the metabolic pathway. Here's hypothyroidism might be related to breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Absolutely. One of the patients that I once had. She was severely hypothyroid. When we met up with her and we met up with her because she had already just received the diagnosis of breast cancer one one case does not a teaching normal make, but there is an association with hypothyroidism as a risk to breast cancer. And the corollary is, I'm testing every single woman that comes to see me when I am doing blood tests, I'm doing that thorough, what I consider to be a thorough screening thyroid panel. And again, that includes the TSH, the free T three, the free T four and a baseline reverse T three, because I'm going to be treating some of these women and I want that baseline of reverse T three do I get into the thyroid antibodies? We'll talk about that later. And the takeaway from this particular article is that hypothyroidism and no low normal free T four are related with an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. There it is, plain as day. Moral of the story, I know I'm repeating myself, but I had a patient with this. And it was very impactful to see a living human being have this severity of hypothyroidism and she was a high functioning woman. And she just wrote it out the severe fatigue and she had it for years. And she kept on truckin and she shows up with a diagnosed breast cancer and severe hypothyroidism and she came to me to help her with the thyroid
