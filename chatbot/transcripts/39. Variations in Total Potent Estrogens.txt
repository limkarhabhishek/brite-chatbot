And now in preparation for this next segment, I'm trusting or hoping that enough of you have had sufficient caffeine and that you're also subject to detoxification pathway challenge is exists because of not secondary to being non useful and that you've now got coffee amplification at this time during the presentation, and if you want this would be good preparation for taking on the next level of detail is it relates to treating women in menopause with bioidentical hormones. So, every year, I go into my 24 hour urine hormone test results. And since there are questionnaires, we have extensive clinical information, I compare the two. And I learned what I learned. And invariably, I learned something every single time I do this. And here's an example of 54 patients. And what we're showing demonstrating on this particular graph is the y axis is micrograms of total potent estrogens appearing in the urine per 24 hour urine hormone collection. And we I've sorted these particular patients numbers one through 54, according to oestrogen output. And what I'd like to illustrate here is that when you compare the member, the nine point number for the 30, the first 30 year old, I've drawn a horizontal line there, that means every one that doesn't go above that line is falling below 9.8, in this case, of total potent estrogens per 24 hour, urine and excretion. And then I've drawn another horizontal line to represent that other 30 year old who's at 12.4. So everyone who falls below the bar is shorter than that particular line. That includes Gosh, it's up to about 2728 women, there are even 30 Women who are actually when we tested them, they came in below that level of that 30 year old, showing the common reference range that I list is between eight and 14 or even up to 24. So I even took it up to 24. And then there's what that 27 year old oestrogen dominant woman, look at that she's coming in higher than 51 of these women that we've tested is only two, or it'd be I guess, be 52. There's only two tested higher than she did. And she was not taking hormones. And most of these were other women were taking hormones, we're in menopause. Well, what's the successive dose about because that's exceeding the 24 level even? That's not even the 14th. What is that excessive dose about? Well, before we go there, I mean, this rectangle, this dotted black rectangle, this is where the common total potent estrogens come in. They're coming in between eight and 14, if you do if you check out with the y axis there. And here's my point with this, there were zero of these women who are menstruating even though they had higher levels, for example, than that 30 year old, then both 30 year olds, a certain number of them had higher levels than that, where that red vertical arrow is pointing down to that thick arrow is pointing down to the level of everything to the right of that. As we move into the higher numbers of the participants, they have higher levels than that menstruating 30 year old. And here's my point. There's a lot more to menstruating than having sufficient amount of oestrogen and dosages administered because none of these women got their period back. So this is one point about menopausal women. You go to restore that period and you can't restore youthful levels. It's not going to do it. I mean, it's not going to bring that period back in order to bring that period back. You gotta go a lot higher than youthful levels and I'll prove that to you in just a little bit.
