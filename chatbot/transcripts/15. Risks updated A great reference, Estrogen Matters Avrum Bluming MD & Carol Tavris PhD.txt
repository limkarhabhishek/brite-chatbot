I want to bring you up to date on the latest information related to risk for women in menopause. It's such an important topic because ever since 2002, and the publication of the whi Women's Health Initiative, there has not been a single woman patient that I've ever sat in front of that whether she told me about it or not, she didn't have a very significant concern about whether if she were to apply these hormones and be treated with hormones, were she putting yourself at risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. And this is very crucial, because we certainly don't want a woman to be electing to be treated with hormones. And at the same time, every time she applies the hormone, she's concerned that you could be creating illness. So we're very proactive about this in the menopause method. And in that first consultation, if you look on your checklist, there is a moment after you take the history that you zero in on discussing the whole subject of risk, and you bring it up. And here's what women want. Most of all, during that discussion, they want to know that you know it in your bones and in your heart, what the precise information about risk is, they don't need to you to give them an hour's lecture or even three sound bites, they can very set much sense whether you know, and you can, you can explain it in three bullet points. And they get it and most of all, they're going to feel it. And so I So it's imperative is that as those of us who are specialising in treating women in menopause, that bioidentical hormones, that we are experts on the subject of risk, and fortunately, we can be because there's been great work done in this area. And we're caught trying to counteract this egregious, incorrect explosion of wrong information that took place in 2002, with the Women's Health Initiative. And I want to begin by saying, Here's what we know to date. We're all at risk or hundreds of diagnoses. We're all at risk for cancer as a man I'm at especially risk for getting prostate cancer, women are at a special risk, we're getting breast cancer. And there's reasons for this. And at the same time, women who are treated with hormones are at less risk for getting breast cancer, heart attack, and stroke than women who are not treated with hormones. Very, very important. And I want you to start from the ground floor of this and learn what you need to learn. So that you know that you're very familiar with the medical literature, and what a time to do it in the history of treating women in menopause. Because in 2018, this absolutely exquisite book came out called oestrogen matters, written by an oncologist album blooming, and his co creator, Carol Taverners Tamaris. And you can see it right over there. oestrogen matters, and as you are, specialising in menopause because you're in the members area of the menopause method, educational segment. It is compulsory imperative that you read from cover to cover. oestrogen matters, you will know. Again, it doesn't obviate that we're all at risk for cancer, but that risk for women is less if they're treated with hormones. And really the best research was based on Premarin, which always had a 0.79 relative risk, and prempro, which, in here's where this study, the Women's Health Initiative, was published in 2017, by the original Investigative Committee, in the original journal, JAMA, that in this is what they say after 18 years of follow up. Women treated with hormones are not at increased risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. Or as they put it, after 18 years of follow up, there is no increased risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. For women treated with hormones. 2017, you can get that publication. And it's covered beautifully in the book. oestrogen matters. So once you read that you're going to know the facts. And then you're going to know it in your backbone in your bones. And I always preface any conversation with a woman saying, Look, we're all at risk. We do our very best in this method to reduce risk as close to zero as we possibly can. But we can't guarantee that there's so many moving parts to risk. But here's what you need to know about risk and hormones. Women who are being treated with hormones are at less risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke than women who go untreated. And again, we're not talking about bioidenticals. There, the European literature has long stated that there's less risk for women who are treated with bioidentical hormones than women who go untreated. So there's the information, I want you to become an expert at it. And you can by reading that book, and are there some grey areas, of course they are an illness, so significant to be as life threatening as breast cancer is, for example, kind of a lot of moving parts. As I explained it to my patients, let's pretend I had a video of your whole life, when I show that you that video up on that wall, from the time you were conceived to now, only the editor pressed a magic button that edited out every beneficial thing that ever happened to you and any beneficial habit you ever had related to diet, and exercise and stress management. And living a great life. All that was edited out what would be left behind would be a multiple 1000s of events, where there was compromised your health compromised your immune system, because of adversities of toxicity, or poor diet or challenging substances that you took, or are how you related to stress and triggering the fight or flight response. So we would see the story of the development of any critical illness 1000s of events, and then there's the mysterious part. So it doesn't have to be totally explainable by ordinary means, why a woman or anyone would get a life threatening illness because there's reasons that go beyond the scope of this educational series and, and for and elude us in many ways, but they do happen. So good explanation of risk, shouldn't take too long. And here's what I do in my office. I'm very attentive during this discussion of risk. Because if after I've said what I have to say, and I ask you a few questions, I still want to assess where the woman herself still feels basically a risk, or has she felt the relief? If she does not feel the relief, I say, Let's pause everything here. There's no medical emergency going on here, I can see that you're not quite certain that this is the right thing for you. And what I can guarantee you is for any given individual woman, the right thing can be knowable, whether to be treated with hormones, or not to be treated with hormones. So why don't we pause? I suggest that you can garner some more information. And here's some resources, our book happy, healthy hormones, Dr. Blooming and Tavis his book, oestrogen matters. And you'll know and you'll know over time as you if you have the intent to know what the truth is for you, that truth will be emerge and you it will be clear. And what we do in the menopause method is We respect your truth, whether it's I want to be treated with hormones, or I don't. And I'm very cautious about this because we don't not want to override something that we can't even name a woman, maybe it's just her intuition. Who knows this could be the woman who is actually sitting on breast cancer cells that have mutated and are in the process of becoming a parent, it takes 10 to 15 years before that first abnormal mitosis into a undifferentiated cell for there to be an actual identifiable lesion. So you know, you want to be cautious and just go for the truth and what the truth is for that individual patient. so rewarding to approach things that way. Now, I want to take us back to yet another subject of this another iteration. I've already said that women who are treated with hormones, even primer and and prempro, her at less risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke than women who go on treated. This was actually known at the time of publication, the one of the leaders of the the Investigative Committee brought committee together to tell them that he wanted to stop the study. And many of the study members said, why would you want to do that there's

no increased incidence of anything. And he said, Well, yes, there is. And they said, No, it's statistically insignificant and statistical significance was published in the original whi. But oh my god, who understands how our history you evolves and manifest, and the press got a hold of this was published, that was printed, it was distributed, and my goodness, I've never seen in the course of my career, the impact on any field of medicine as diverse as The public publication in the Women's Health Initiative and the damage that it did to American women and women worldwide, there were 18 million American women and hormones prior to 2002. That was 40% of the American women in menopause. And after that study came out that number cascaded so low. Even by recovery time of 2016, when was published, that there were about 5 million American women being treated with hormones, and over half of them are uncompounded bioidentical hormones. That's a whole other story, I'm not going to go there, there's one more issue that I want to deal with. Here's another interesting thing. Women who have had breast cancer and are at increased risk of recurrence, then over a woman who's never had cancer, breast cancer is at risk for getting breast cancer, that risk of recurrence is increased. But that risk of recurrence is less. If a woman is treated with hormones, and even with a bracket one, or bracket, I'm sorry, a bracket mutation, who have four times the risk for breast cancer, that risk is less if they're treated with hormones. Hmm. And I'm bringing up the subject for another reason. Because in the course of your career, if you devote a good portion or all of your career to specialising in treating women in menopause, you are going to be received the requests from women who have had breast cancer, and are experienced the awful effects of no ovarian hormones and are wanting to be treated. And you will face that. And when I originally faced that very early on in my career, I sort of got a little nervous. But I had, I listened very carefully to the patient. And if the patient felt like that she was going to be an excellent patient, most of them do. I, I agreed to do it. And now in my practice, after many years, I've treated many women who've had a history of breast cancer. The the earliest someone is now is seven years out, I've got a woman who's 15 years out thriving, because people heal, and oh, my God, these women are so grateful to be treated. And there is something that I do. And I'm not suggesting this, this is a personal decision as a member of the menopause method. We do not tell you anything, really. But there are certain parameters of of practice that we do define very carefully. So I take that back. But one of them we don't define is whether or not you choose about treating any woman patient that you ever encounter, including those who have a prior history of breast cancer, that's up to you. That's up to your value system, your risk tolerance is totally up to you. But here's what I do. If I decide that I want to treat a woman who's had a prior history of breast cancer with hormones, I have her craft and informed consent, in her own words, and I say to this, I say this to her, I said look, you and I are going to develop a doctor patient relationship. And I'm not I'm never going to be concerned about you. And there is a risk of recurrence. And with that risk of recurrence, my God, rarely there is a very untoward event, such as you passing away. And the thing of this happening in this medical world these days, is there might be a distant relative or someone who doesn't know you or didn't know you or didn't know me or didn't know what you're doing when they learned that you were on being treated with hormones and you had a breast cancer even though they don't know the science, they may want to take punitive action against the physician. So what I expect the woman to do is this, I want you to pretend you're sitting in front of a medical board, or a judge and a jury. And this letter is being read and you've passed away. And I want it to come from your heart and your soul that you understand the risks and benefits and you know what you want to choose? And you absolve everyone from risk. This isn't legally infallible, but this is what I do. And I've read some very, very touching testimonies from women informed consents from women. So, big topic. Let's go back to the basics. Women who are treated with hormones are less risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke than women who go untreated. And let's look at one more facet of that. Women who are not protected by hormones are at almost a significant risk, if almost near certainty of issues of vaginal atrophy. sarcopenia fall of the bladder in the uterus. Incontinence depends sarcopenia of the skeletal muscles, weakness in the inability to walk with with care entrance in with with stability, and they fall and ask the operatic bones and they fracture those bones and they get they're subject to dimension. They're subject to arterial sclerosis in heart attack, after all half the women who die die from heart attacks and complications of atherosclerosis in strokes. So it's not like this is just like this simple mathematical equation. But I don't think I want to take hormones. No, as I said over and over again. There may be risk in taking hormones, so I don't know what there is. And there is a few grey areas. And I am in communication with Dr. Blooming and we try and sort out those grey areas. But there's almost a new certainty of serious life challenging, nursing home putting all kinds of challenges that result from not taking hormones. So there's a lot of moving parts to this particular field. One final time. This because I'm always amazed and how it's challenging and be the antidote this wrong information where you're given women who were treated with hormones or less risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke than women who go untreated.
