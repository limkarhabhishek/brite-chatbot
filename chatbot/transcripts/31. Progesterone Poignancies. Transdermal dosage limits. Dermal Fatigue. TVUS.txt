So I want to summarise some of the progesterone poignancy these things that really matter progesterone, it's of core importance. Oh my goodness, every woman should be treated with progesterone who's in menopause? Absolutely. And get that dose right and there's going to be very rare but actual women that you won't be able to. But that's going to be very rare and then achieving adequate transdermal dosage can be a challenge. And that's so much in the young women because their skin is healthy and we're asking a woman's skin to absorb more progesterone. Then we are these other hormones. I mean, for example, the starting dose of bias is 30 milligrammes per millilitre, at 20 ratio, the starting dose of progesterone in fact, the only dose of progesterone we use with very rare exceptions in the organic oils is 200 milligrammes per millilitre. Why would we do that? Because a woman's body wants so much more progesterone, and believe me, if it would be easy to make something stronger than 200 milligrammes per millilitre, I would, but there's solubility issues, we can't, it's the suspension gets too thick, and you even run into this, in the, the solvent bases like you can only get 200 milligrammes per millilitre, in carbopol, at which you try and go above 200 You is going to start you're gonna start getting a dust residual, the powdered progesterone is gonna come out of solution, and you can get, I'm sorry, you can get 200 milligrammes per millilitre with lipid Derm, you can barely go above a 10% or 100 milligrammes per millilitre, in carbopol. There are solubility limits to even with the solvents. So, I'm saying that we're asking a woman's body to absorb more because she likes more progesterone. And so sometimes achieving the dose transdermally is a challenge, and, again, the milligrammes needed are actually comparatively high to oestrogen and testosterone, and there's a subject called dermal fatigue. That means the skin that was one time a good absorber, and absorbed, just all you needed of the progesterone. That may change over time because a woman's skin can change over time. Now, the earlier you intercept and treat her with bioidentical hormones and perimenopause and menopause, the healthier that skin is going to maintain for the longer period of time. And I've I've had the opportunity to do that. treating women in their early perimenopause, and my goodness, I didn't run into dermal fatigue until 15 years in them thinking and one patient, and then eventually I did so yeah. And always in your physical exam. Take a look at that quality, that skin because you're gonna see over time as that quality changes is probably is changing in your very own skin over time. And so in your tool bag, you're going to not only need transdermal formulations, you're going to need to know how to apply progesterone translate early and introvert, vaginally and oral forms. They're going to be needed in your toolkit. Not so with biassed and testosterone. My goodness the organic oils for examples are going to work for 90 95% of the patients and they're going to keep working for those patients over time. transvaginal ultrasound can be an important tool in monitoring the endometrium because one of the goals with having adequate progesterone is you suppress the growth of the endometrium. That's why they put Provera in with Premarin was to suppress the endometrium and they use rather substantial doses. Now I'm going to have a lot more to say about that. Because it just doesn't take that much to have a nice thin endometrium. And I find that my own experience clinically and I've done transvaginal, ultrasounds and so many women is that you can get a very thin and a mutual stripe with adequate transdermal progesterone. But at any rate, mentioning this word, this tool, trans vaginal ultrasound, because it can be an important tool for you and especially when you get a bleed, and you're going to see your share of bleeding occur not very infrequent in my practice, my God, maybe one out of 50 or 100 women that I'm treating. I've ever done any bleeding beyond the usual type of spotting stuff that can occur in the perimenopause. But you're going to run into it and that transvaginal ultrasound, and how well progesterone is suppressing the endometrium that can be the kindest cause of spawning and bleeding is inadequate progesterone, to balance the oestrogen that you're treating a woman with. Now it turns out that the dosage we're talking about entreating women in menopause are not huge. They're not moderate. For the most part, they're quite minimal. It just doesn't take much to get all the advantages we want. Out of replenishing steroid hormones, ovarian hormones. So how much progesterone you're going to need to balance a lot of these women, you're not going to need useful levels. Man, it's we don't prescribe useful levels, we never get that period to return. And I have a lot more to say about that. But at any rate, just know that it just doesn't take that much. So you're going to do just fine with transdermal doses of progesterone. And there's going to be times you're going to want to be more aggressive, especially if there's been osteopenia or osteoporosis. And at times, there's definite place for oral progesterone in cases of sleep disturbance, that don't respond to transdermal. And it's because of a slide I showed you about that allopregnanolone, one of the metabolites and progesterone. But what I'm saying here in the progesterone poignancy is, is be cautious with oral progesterone dosages greater than 75 milligrammes because as you're going to see, when we get into testing, that's going to produce some very high pregnant dal levels a lot because of first pass, of course, primarily because of first pass effects. So progesterone, in general, is in various states of balance with oestrogen. And unfortunately, in practice, it's mostly imbalance. So why I'm singling this out is watch out for this one. And mostly progesterone is deficient with respect to oestrogen. So I can't keep on emphasising it. I keep on returning to it. Progesterone is a great friend of women. And then what is the optimal dose and progesterone? Well, one is a dose sufficient to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, because progesterone will help prevent endometrial hyperplasia, and how you're gonna find that out by transvaginal ultrasound, which is part of the agreements that we have women signed prior to that first consultation, so that they know if they're going to be working with me, for example, if there's a series of agreements for them, because I never want to surprise them later. I never want to say to them, well, you we have to have mammograms at certain interval and it's time for a mammogram now and they say, Well, I don't ever get a mammogram. So I don't want them to be able to say that for for reasons that I will specify. And the same with trans vaginal ultrasound, I don't want them to be blindsided and learn later that Oh, got to do get off transvaginal ultrasound, getting transvaginal ultrasound every year anymore, okay used to or on every patient, like I used to. But my goodness, I sure am using that tool, and you'll want to use it as well. And what's the optimal dose? Well, it's coming down to does house, how strongly does progesterone relate to the thickness of that and a mutual stripe, and various articles and physicians have various criteria. And one criteria that's absolute is you don't want any irregularities, that endometrium because that irregularity could be a tumour. But some except five millimetres or less is an adequate and fine endometrial stripe or some that criteria is more stringent, they'll want four millimetres, and the lowest I've seen criteria for stringency of the thickness of the endometrial stripe is three millimetres and this should be specified on a trans vaginal ultrasound report. But again, the bottom line is no irregularities and then and medium or further studies need to be done. And how do you do further studies what a gynaecologist can do a hysteroscopy or an endometrial biopsy and these are tools that are not necessarily they're not in my tool bag. I have always had relationships with gynaecologist. My goodness. obstetrics and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists had been a very important part of my teammates to deliver babies. So that's when I met up with them. And then great gynaecologist or associate important parts of the team. So good qualities sagittal transvaginal ultrasound adequately demonstrates the endometrium that's what you're looking for.
