Talk about one element of cancer risk. And everyone is familiar with at this time that in 2002, the Women's Health Initiative falsely stated that there was increased risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke for women were treated with hormones. They were referring to Premarin and prempro. They're really only referring to prempro. Premarin had less of a risk associated with it and prempro at 1.26 quotes statistically insignificant, and, quote, increase in risk for breast cancer that by 2017, when the original study committee printed in the original journal American Medical Association or retraction of the 2002 Women's Health Initiative stating that after 18 years of follow up, there was no increased risk for breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. resending their original incorrect reporting of a statistically insignificant increase risk was prempro. Well, in the interim, there was all kinds of thoughts that came about without solid science behind it, and one of the elements was that hormones probably didn't initiate breast cancer. But if the breast cancer had oestrogen receptor site, positive cells in the breast cancer, that oestrogen treatment would probably promote the development of breast cancer. Now, that was a thought. Now that thought, I've discussed in person with Dr. Avraham blooming and for those of you who have not read this book, oestrogen matters by Avraham blooming oncologist and Carol, Tavis, this is required reading for all those you view in the menopause method specialisation programme, that this is a very grey area. And Dr. Blooming and personal communication said this, that in any cancer, any tumour there's can be a variety of well differentiated to very undifferentiated cancer cells. And well differentiated cells have the architecture and the internal physiology that quite resembles a parent gland or cell. In other words, part of a normal breast glandular cell, or there is oestrogen receptor sites within those cells. And Dr. Bluemix point is this that it's not the tumour part that has the oestrogen receptor site positive cells, which are well differentiated, that are the problem. The problem in any given cancer are the undifferentiated cells that are not under the control of anything. If this sounds a little blurry to you, it is a little blurry, but it is the those of you who are inactive specialisation practice, you're going to be approached by women who've had breast cancer and have had breast cancer properly treated. And one of the points that Dr. Blooming and Dr. Tabriz make is that in a woman who's had breast cancer, and their breast cancer has been positive had been properly treated. Even though that woman is at greater risk for recurrence than a woman has never had breast cancer is for getting breast cancer. That woman is at less of a risk for recurrence if she's treated with hormones than a woman who has untreated less of a risk of recurrence if a woman's treated. And the hormones that Dr blooming is talking about is prempro and Premarin. Now, also embedded within that is this unclear distinction about if a woman has a PET scan of breast cancer with oestrogen positive receptor sites, if treating her with oestrogen is going to stimulate that cancer? And I'm going to leave this up to a certain amount of unclarity. But that it is not an absolute that that's going to promote recurrence or promote cancer development. Absolutely not. And it's for the reason is, cancers have oestrogen healthy cells in there a relatively healthy Sarah cells mode relatively well differentiated and the undifferentiated cells, which are the ones that are the real problem inside of a breast cancer. The overall in overarching medical science says and Dr. Blooming Dr. Tabriz go into this is that women who are treated with hormones, who've had breast cancer and had that breast cancer properly treated are at less risk for recurrence than women who are untreated. And here we're not talking about bioidenticals. The literature is not doesn't isn't referring to that it's referring to primary and prempro. So there are so many 1000s of moving parts to how someone has a life threatening illness of any kind, including breast cancer and want to blur the margins around. Are the oestrogen receptor sites relevant or not? Just to let you know, I have treated many women and I'm treating now women who've had breast cancer and who had their breast cancer properly treated.
