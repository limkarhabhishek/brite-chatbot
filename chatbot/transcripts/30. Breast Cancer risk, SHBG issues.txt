And Dr. Holtorf, in that article that I mentioned to you before, he comments on progesterone as well, and so, so important that one would, and the both the physiologic and clinical data have indicated that progesterone is associated with a diminished risk for breast cancer compared with the increased risk associated with the synthetic progestins. That was the problem prempro, the progestin hydroxy progesterone acetate, which is the progesterone used in prempro or that's the Provera part. So there's a difference in risk from using natural progesterone bioidentical progesterone diminished risk using congestions increased risk for breast cancer? That is something and I've just spoken about that. And then is progesterone breast cancer protective? Well, in order to investigate the nature of the association and voluntarily delayed first birth and risk of breast cancer women in the pregnant dial, which is progesterone deficiency, that's how we measure progesterone in the urine, which is the way you measure progesterone accurately. And that's what these researchers did. The women who had pregnancy dial had 5.4 times the risk of pre menopausal breast cancer compared to women who had adequate progesterone. In other words, a deficiency of progesterone increased the risk for breast cancer pre menopausal the 5.4 times. Wow. This excess risk could not be explained by differences between the two groups in ages and medically are menopause and usual things, history of oral contraceptive use, what they're saying is women who had less progesterone early on in their life in their adult life, were at greater risk for breast cancer. Now, is there any other information about progesterone? Is it possible that it's a breast cancer promoter, because it'd be so easy to believe in the miracle of what progesterone is, but I want to tell you, when you dive into that medical literature, you're going to see yes, and no pros and cons. And this is not the prevalent information that's suggesting the progesterone could be provocative, but that that information does exist. And so there's contradictory results concerning the proliferative effects of progesterone, which may be associated with a different local metabolism and normal compared to malignant breast tissue similar to the other progestogens. So, we would love I would let me say I would love to wrest the case, that the problem was prempro Was it that it was the Provera molecule, and it was that it was a progestin, and which is biochemically way different than the actual progesterone molecule and it behaves differently. It's much more testosterone rich, for example, I would have loved to rest solely on the possibility that progesterone was protective. And then the culprit was the artificial progestin. But you can't entirely walk away from this one. So a medicines complex. So wouldn't it be convenient to stay with our belief that progesterone protected against breast cancer caution with robust there's a tendency out there to treat with very robust levels of oral progesterone? And I'm bringing up this other possibility? Because we don't know the final answers aren't in, I think in a certain way that final answers are in on cancer, that it's not a one thing, one hormone, one factor, cause that there's a multitude of causes that try and find the scientific studies that is going to show that there's one specific cause to breast cancer is crazy. But at the same time, we're trying to get the risk reduced to as close to zero as we can. So I say, be cautious about these excessive amounts of progesterone that are can produce these very high pregnant dal levels, when you're using oral progesterone. And if you've got sleep issues, don't try and get the whole job done. With progesterone, there's other factors to sleep disturbance. So I'm gonna have more to say about that. And you're gonna I'm gonna give you illustrate to you what can happen with oral progesterone. But again, am I blurring? The beauty of progesterone is cancer protective? Well, in general, it's wonderful. It's amazing. I had a private conversation with many private conversations with Dr. Lee. He was such a generous physician. He's deceased now. But what a contributor, and I asked him once I have a woman who's come to me who had breast cancer, and she's got oestrogen positive receptor sites and progesterone positive receptor sites. And I said, would you treat her with progesterone? I mean, after all, progesterone supposed to be so cancer preventative? And he said, Well, this is a tough one. And he said, just let's just take one reason alone. If this is the medical committee, Any and relatives who don't know you well of the patient would never forgive you for treating a woman who had progesterone positive receptor sites with progesterone, doesn't mean I haven't done this. I definitely have. And that's a whole discussion that we will have in another time. But he was recommending caution. Let's begin with that, that you got to know your patient and know your medical community. Because if something adverse or untoward happened to that woman, you might be the word there where they're going to try and seek recompense from. So at any rate, these are the I'm now walking into the most challenging issue you'll run into in menopause and treating women in menopause about identical hormones. And it's those women who've had breast cancer. And they are having a rough time with hormonal deficiency symptoms. What are you gonna do about that? And we'll leave that for later discussion. And just know, I love progesterone. Why do I love progesterone, because women love progesterone. So many women have extolled the virtues of progesterone. And what a major difference is done in life, I'm just saying, let's apply a certain a significant level of care to the administration of progesterone. And, boy, if you apply a transdermally, you're going to have that level of care, you're just not going to be able to get those levels up to super charged levels is when you move into the oral that you can get up pretty high levels of pregnancy now, so I have more to say about that as we go on. And then progesterone is capable of affecting sex hormone binding globulin because these steroid hormones are being transported around in the aqueous blood bound to plasma proteins, because they're not going to float around in their little as little fat bubbles. They're mostly most almost entirely Not, not entirely bound to many binding proteins in the most prominent one for oestrogen and testosterone is sex hormone binding globulin, but progesterone will also affect sex hormone binding globulin levels. Now, these are rather outrageous doses of let's say, 400 milligrammes, if you see that there were 17 Women on 400 milligrammes, they had spectrum and binding globulins of in this case, 45, they don't I don't know what the laboratory normal is, it failed to notate that. But 45 In general, depends on laboratory reference range, of course, but look what happens when you increase the dose and 400 800 1200 You're popping up that sex hormone binding globulin? Well, I'd like to welcome you to the world of sex hormone binding globulin because you're not going to run into problems with it often. Or also, I say frequently, but you want to keep your eye on this prize. You may remember that I said that my initial blood workup and doesn't doesn't matter what a woman has walked into that office, if she's walked in with the most extensive and beautiful blood test results for her first visit with you. And you go, Oh my God, this doctor really knew what they're doing is so many wonderful tests that evaluate so many different systems. Here's the state of the art and what they've chosen, but I don't see the sex hormone binding globulin. I'm going to say, Oh, we've got one more blood test to do. It's just one, but we want to have an initial sex hormone binding globulin. So right now I'm just introducing you to the magical and sometimes challenging world of sex hormone binding globulin. Really when it goes awry. And what's going to make it go awry. Excessive dosages, so if you avoid excessive dosages of steroid hormones, you're not going to have a problem with sex hormone binding globulin just to keep it simple. That's the thing that pushes up sex hormone binding globulin to excessive and thus difficult to deal with. When it goes elevates. Now there is one other thing that will do it. There's some women when they take birth control pill well, most every woman who takes birth control pills, they're taking additional hormones to the body to protect themselves increases external binding globulin. Well, when they stopped the birth control pill, doesn't every second hormone binding globulin returned to normal wish it would.

Not every woman actually has a reduction back into normal ranges external binding globulin, a diversion? Man, I want you to introduce you to this topic called sex hormone binding globulin because if you're going to get into challenges, this is one way to do it. And the main way that people get into challenges with sex hormone binding globulin is they prescribe too much hormone Oops, didn't know my dosages. Oops, those determination went a little too fast. Oops, I started playing with the ratios before I hadn't really fully understood the ratios. biassed and I increased the amount of estradiol from at 22 6040 which is 40% is extra dial. Oops that increase the dosage and a push the sex hormone binding globulin. So if this is cloudy to you now and foggy to you now, we'll definitely have more to say about sex hormone binding globulin, I wanted to welcome you to the world of sex hormone binding globulin. And those of you who are watching these videos and who subscribe to the menopause method. If you run into tough cases, I want to just let you know now that I'm available to you, if you're prescribing the oils and you're using this method, you have no charge access to me to discuss your challenging cases with and my goodness, I enjoy that so much. And I know that if that's what I'm doing with you, that we're furthering the whole world of treating women in menopause about identical hormones by moving the expertise forward. And we also have staff members that can discuss some of your entry cases with you
