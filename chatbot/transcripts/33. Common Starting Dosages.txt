So here's the progesterone common starting dosage and young, healthier skin. We use progesterone 200 milligrammes per millilitre, 100%. of the women that I see for the very first time in perimenopause or menopause, this is what they get this progesterone prescription. So with all that I'm saying and all the apparent complexity of it, when it comes down to that first office visit. She's going to walk out the door with a prescription of bias 100% of the time, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20 and the organic oils mix, and the progesterone prescription is just gonna walk out of the office with 100% of the time is going to be 200 milligrammes per millilitre, and one woman out of 200 Am I going to change that progesterone 200 milligrammes per millilitre, so the progesterone that she goes out with, that's not going to change unless we move to transmucosal and trans dermal and oral and the progesterone is in the organic oils base, and it's going to be eight and a half millilitres in a 30 millilitre bottle, that gives you shake room. And when I originally was designing this, I chose a bottle size, not based on how much oil I wanted to put in there, I based it on was the bottle tall enough to receive the standard pharmacy label. And that get the combining pharmacist into a new size label that they have to produce that they don't have the technology to produce, and they've got to invent. So that's why that bottle is 30 millilitres tall. It's one hour, it's almost, and that's why we chose that size, but we only put in eight and a half millilitres, because that's one month's supply, when we figure out transdermal, transmucosal, progesterone, and turns out, that that's 8.7 milligrammes per drop. Well, how do we know that? And what determines that? Well, a lot of work has determined that originally with my mother in law, and then years later, my partner and my son, and I have done really careful dropped determination. We want to know how many drops come out of that bottle. And what's the average drop size because they're a little different, sometimes a little variation and drop size, and to get the orifice reducer this right size and it's different orifice reducer for that progesterone, I suggest you don't try and reinvent the wheel. A lot went into this discovery, and what we can tell you for sure is for progesterone, 200 milligrammes per millilitre, there's 8.7 milligrammes per drop, because there's 23 point something drops per millilitre, and that's how we determine that and we actually used our filming equipment to slow down to, to film it in real time, and then to slow it down and slow motion because we could actually count the drops. So, just know, it turns out to be 8.7 milligrammes per drop when you do the math. So, for the to drop progesterone starting dose, which is the most common starting dose for most women that I see in that first visit, that turns out that they're getting 17 milligrammes right out of the gate transdermally that's pretty interesting. The over the counter stuff, especially in Dr. Lee was originating that stuff, it was 18 it was 1.8%, which is 18 milligrammes per millilitre. That's coincidental, we found it a different way, but probably the process was the same, because that's a great starting dose 70 milligrammes because 1.8%, over the counter, progesterone millilitre of it is going to do a lot of young women a lot of good. So just to put it in a reference point for how much does it take to do some good, especially in the young woman. And we'll titrate up, oh, ways that we're titration will those determine up will gradually increase that up to a six drops maximum transdermal, which happens to be 52 milligrammes and most of the women who are going to do well with transdermal, do just fine between two drops in six drops. And we usually provide that HS only, although sometimes you can split that dose. And that's going to be a good dose for most of the women who do well with transdermal, or transmucosal. And if you're not getting the amount of progesterone dosage that you want, and you're usually going to find that through testing, there are very specific progesterone deficiency symptoms as illustrated on that starting dose card and at different places. And yet, testing is the ultimate arbiter for that. And testing is primarily going to reveal whether you're getting enough. Now very many women are going to have progesterone deficiency symptoms, they can't fall asleep, well, they're a little more anxious, and they start taking progesterone they feel calmer and they fall asleep better. So the dose determination by symptom alleviation works really well. And if you take too much progesterone at night, you're gonna get too calm. Well, another way to say that is you're going to wake up still feeling groggy, like somebody's taken an overdose of a sleeping pill or something. That is definitely the sign of an excessive amount of progesterone taken HS. And then B ID administration will I had many women come to me, especially in the beginning and say, I love this progesterone. And is there any reason why I can't do what I've already done, which is I'm also taking some in the morning and it makes my days and feel so much calmer. And what did I know? I said, fine. So when a woman usually we recommend HS administration only a progesterone because we want assists that sleep so much. And we don't want to get woman groggy during the day. But whenever a woman has said, I'm a little more anxious during the day, I say, Hey, listen, put on a couple of drops in the morning and determine what dose you want to put in the morning as well. Because transdermally you're not going to get too much progesterone into a woman. So it's very safe. The real limitation can be as how much oil you're going to apply to the skin. You don't want to be using too much oil. It's just never messy that oil but you know, it's a lot to apply over six drops a day. It's a lot of oil. And here's the over counter, over the counter progesterone. I mentioned this because boy I wish the word was out in this was certainly Dr. Lee's intent is get that word out to the young women, that they want to keep their eye on the prize of being able to identify when their progesterone starts to fall in the early 30s. And just take some progesterone it's so easy, and the carriers used in these well, they have to be solvents. So they are mixed because not being able to shake a tube of gel or something like that. And often like I was saying the milligrammes per millilitre happened to be 18 And then he's also can be administered by a compounding pharmacist, I'm illustrating a pump bottle there, and the carbopol is a common carrier when you can get 30 milligrammes per mil, which is 15 milligrammes per pump is a common one, and you definitely can go higher on that in carbopol, you can get 100 milligrammes per millilitre, and that means you'd be administering 50 milligrammes per pump, and if you go up to a more intense solvent, like lipid Derm, you can get it up as high as 200 milligrammes per millilitre, can't go higher than that, which is 100 milligrammes per pump.

Let's talk about progesterone absorption, topical absorption of progesterone can vary significantly, woman to woman from good to not good. And also, over time, a woman who's absorbing transdermal progesterone just just fine, may not continue to do that forever. And that is that dermal fatigue phenomena, and recall that the mid luteal progesterone levels that are 100 times greater than oestrogen and a young woman so we're asking a woman's body to absorb so much more progesterone, not to youthful levels, but it just shows you the proportions. So compare the dosages we were wanting to absorb, like for example, and bias the milligrammes per millilitre. 30. milligrammes per millilitre is a good common starting dose, you're not going to stay at 30 as I will illustrate for you. And progesterone, a common starting dose, the intact common, I mean, these are the dosages I start, as I've said several times, every single woman has ever walked in my office for the last 10 years. My work with women in menopause and Daisy I was using creams and gels earlier in my career, that's for sure. And then the drops per millilitre, they're different for biassed and this is rounded off and for progesterone there is actually decimals there and we know those decimals, the milligrammes per drop, again for this is bias, this is milligrammes per drops a bias, that's, that's what's mushed in there is both the oestrogen and estradiol I'm not breaking them out in this case, because look at that the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, for the bias is point four, four. So as far as the maximum drops per application, if we usually tap off the abayas to three drops PID, which is six drops, that's the upper limit of acceptability, and six drops for progesterone. So the amount that we're administering the progesterone all at once, most often so the actual milligrammes of application is 4.5 for the biassed that's mushing the estriol and milligrammes in the estradiol together, which is fine for what we're just estimating here. But common dose of progesterone is 52. So that is 10 times as much progesterone. So just know we're asking a woman's body to absorb 10 times as much progesterone, that dose for bias of 1.3 milligrammes of estradiol equivalents, that's what that turns out to be. That could be very sufficient for a lot of women whereas this may or may not be sufficient progesterone for all women. This is going to be revealed in the 24 hour urine hormone testing, and also on trans vaginal ultrasound, are we getting sufficient suppression of the endometrium, and also, eye symptoms, symptom alleviation or symptom access, lot of information. Again, practically speaking, you can do that first visit, you're going to review the questionnaire and if you do physical exams you're gonna do in female exams, you're gonna do that, and you're gonna walk out the door with the same prescription every single time that the tweaking process to get it optimal. That's where the steps come in, in. But what my whole intention here is, I love this knowledge base.

How did I acquire this is because



10:41

woman after woman, patient after patient drove me to have to discover the latest thing and explain what's going on here. And how do I figure out how to help her get to the optimal level. And you know, 25 years later, there's a knowledge base that I've acquired, and I think it'll serve you beautifully. You don't have to know it all at once. All you need to do is have a professional medical medical degree of great merit such as a medical doctor or osteopathic physician, or naturopathic physician, or nurse practitioner, you can bet education plus the desire to treat women in menopause and two little bottles are gonna get you going just fine. You'll learn it like I learned it. I learned it patient by patient. But this is laying down the whole knowledge base and however much of it you're able to retain. Eventually, sooner or later, you keep treating women and menopause with hormones, you're going to discover this whole knowledge base on your own patient by patient. And there's remedies if things are insufficient. You can rotate that skin application site Oh yeah, rotation, rotation rotation. That means you don't apply the progesterone to the exact same site and we're gonna teach you about where to apply the progesterone and the oestrogen, etc. And then if the skin rotation doesn't work, mucosal applications work and then also so do oral and progesterone orally is fine. That is different than oestrogen orally. Not that millions and millions of women haven't received oestrogen orally, but there's problems with it. And those problems will not be seen in the in the healthy and robustly healthy women. But in the sensitive ones, we're again, trying to reduce the risk of close to zero as we can possibly get it. And as far as progesterone absorption goes transmucosal works on the labia vagina, and the external periodontal mucosa after a shower. These are all adequate sites to apply the wonderful sites to apply progesterone to, if a woman is having frequent intercourse, I recommend that they choose the external perianal mucosa. Not that progesterone is going to be in the amount of progesterone they pick up that their partner would pick up during intercourse is going to be a big deal, but it's never been tested. We've never tested the men who are having frequent intercourse with women or playing vaginal hormones. Now I'm going to say more about that because we do know that those hormones can linger in the vagina, that will surprise you. And I'm going to cover that later on. So whatever it is, when you start off with transmucosal, let's say that you had made it up to six drops of progesterone transdermally. And you weren't getting full symptom alleviation? Well, when you go to apply transmucosal, you don't start with the six drops, start with three drops, for example, or two drops, we start off with reduced dose, because you're going to most likely get facilitated absorption through these mucosal sites. That's how they behave as far as absorption goes most all the time. And then ultimately, if you're not able to accomplish what you need to accomplish with progesterone, you can switch to oral to transmucosal is not effective. I'm happy to do that. And I do that. And then I have a certain significant percentage of my patients who are on oral progesterone. If you're going to dose determine with oral progesterone, what's going to work for most women and this is what I do. I prescribe a bottle of 30 capsules of compounded micronized progesterone of 25 milligrammes and another third bottle of 30 capsules of 50 milligrammes and I'll start most women off, who obviously are, are used to progesterone, they're in the early perimenopause and menopause, their bodies are used to significant levels of progesterone. I'll start them off with 50 milligrammes and titrate them upwards by 25 milligrammes each time now, some of the more sensitive women I'm going to start with 25 milligrammes in titrate them up by 25, milligrammes maybe once a week, once every 10 days. So, that is the usual prescription I write when I'm turning towards oral progesterone, once you determine the dose, you of course, do it in one capsule because it costs if it turns out to be 50 milligrammes. That's what you that's the final capsule size because it's the cost per capsule, but it's identical, no matter how many milligrammes you stick in there, in that capsule, and again, Take these HS and increased dose by 25 milligrammes every five to 10 days with the progesterone even up to two weeks. And when you get the 75 milligramme Mark most of the time you're going to get adequate symptom alleviation. So you're going to be testing at the 75 milligramme You can go higher, I've gone 225 milligrammes even 150. milligrammes pretty rarely, you're going to see very high urinary pregnancy dial levels at that level. You're gonna see high levels even at the 75 milligrammes but just to know, when the pharmaceutical companies started working with what they call bio identical micronized progesterone. Yeah in the name of it commercially is prometrium It only comes in two doses, 100 milligrammes and 200 milligrammes, and they claimed that that was the amount that it took to adequately suppress and a mutual lining and I have a two thick met in a mutual learning. Now, I have not found this to be the case at all I'm going to illustrate this to you. I have got very thin stripes with 25 milligrammes 50 milligrammes 75. milligrammes all depends on the woman and where she is in the perimenopause. Because the later you're into the menopause do you need, you might need these robust doses to suppress the endometrium in a young woman who is used to producing a significant substantial endometrium, but you don't need it in the older women and that's for sure. And then if they're you, if you have one of these women who are especially sensitive to progesterone, you can even start out with five milligramme compounded dosage and titrate from that, so, I mean, the easiest way if she's sensitive, you start with 25 milligrammes, but you can have to use less and these these women are out there, where they're tolerating 2345 1015 milligrammes, maximum overall progesterone and again once the optimal dose the total optimum loss is discovered clinically, a single capsule can be created in that keeps it very much less expensive. So, the, again, the major takeaway is identify progesterone declined, often by oestrogen dominance, endorses a cessation of ovulation. That's a sure sign, but the earlier signs are not ovulation cessation and the cessation of our ultimately cessation administration and treat with progesterone. It has major benefit. We love progesterone, I mean, I love progesterone, because of the effect it has on women as reported by the women and also because what our medical literature tells us about progesterone
