Now, I want a comparison I want to go deeper into the level of comparison these levels and one way we can compare them is by the dosage of milligrammes of estradiol equivalent. We're talking primarily about oestrogen here, because although I presented risk possibilities of progesterone, the real concern in the medical community, primarily and not totally exclusively, revolves around oestrogen. So that's why I'm putting all the attention on that. And so just to develop a spectrum of possibility and putting the one milligramme of estradiol, cool and per dosage, and that line 2345, and then up into super physiologic, and then on the lower part of that graph, I'm listing what woman is testing out ad, and we're testing, we're listing it as micrograms of whatever we're talking about per 24 hour urine. In this case, we're talking about the total potent estrogens that would be the sun of the 24 hour excretion of estradiol plus estriol, I'm sorry, estradiol plus this drone. Absolutely the total potent estrogens Ester dal plus as strong. So there's different scale for this, because eight micrograms 1624 3240 is more of the scale for this. And let me give you some ideas where women appear on this spectrum of hormone levels. Well, serendipitously, I had a patient that I was treating in menopause. And once she saw the value of the 24 hour urine hormone test, she said, Gee, I sure wish I had done this when I was a young woman at the height of my hormonal output, so I could compare. And in fact, I've got a daughter and a future daughter in law, that I'm going to send them in here. They're both very healthy, but I think if they got tested now, they'd really appreciate it in the future. And so that's what we did. And so these two women that I'm about to present to you, they came in at the suggestion of their mother slash future mother in law. And they were feeling great. They were living very active lives. And here's the results of a 30 year old when we added up restaurant plus restaurant dial, she came in at 9.8. So that's where she lives in the spectrum of all possibilities. And the other, the future daughter in law came in at 12.4. When we added an extra dial, these are two young, normal BMI, healthy women leading very active lives. I had the opportunity to test another young woman who came there, who the claim was that she was in good health. And the reason that she showed up here is her mother had developed breast cancer. And her mother had a suspicion that testing the hormones could have helped her along the way and it would be good for her daughter, who she recognised had some of the health issues that she had, could anticipate to see if there's a hormonal relationship to putting her at risk. And this woman was slightly overweight, someone overweight, large breasted short of stature. Just by physical examination alone, she was obviously oestrogen dominant, and by the questionnaire which she had, she had breast chronic breast tenderness. And so Oh, my just clinically, I was wondering, is this woman at risk? And this is where she tested a very unusual test level. She was 27 years old, she was oestrogen dominant, oh, my goodness, her total potent estrogens came in at 35. So there's just a sample of three, but it helps you see where we're starting to develop a overall picture of what not what numbers are we talking about. And there's more data on this on these young women and other lab values in the appendix. Now let's talk about the spectrum of possibilities of treatment from no RX to minimum, moderate and robust and super physiologic levels. Well, here's where they come in. Well, over the course of over a decade in the testing of women and comparing it to the dosages, I've learned that the dosage range that women were choosing in my practice was from point eight. And of course, we're now dealing with the purple scale. So the point eight is falling shy of the zero, the 0.8 is falling shy of the numeral one. And the 2.6 is just about midpoint between two and three of the purple numbers on the upside of that linear graph there. And then the average in my practice of how much women are applying. We've seen the pitfalls of blinding, the average dose is 1.7 milligrammes of estradiol, equivalent, and now I'm putting those arrows to help us remember where those two young healthy women tested and where that woman who has oestrogen dominance tested and the two young healthy women came in between eight and 14. Now, of course, their numbers weren't nine plus in 12 Plus, why is it eight to 14 Because I've since had hundreds and hundreds of data points, and I compared the amount of total pote nationals. things that appear on a 24 hour urine hormone test with our medical literature and when you piece the puzzles together, and there's quite a piecing to do the scientific studies and how they relate to risk for breast cancer and how they relate to endometrial proliferation and how they relate to on the on the other side, the osteoporosis and sarcopenia, you've put all that mixed together. And you can dive into that mixture of resources yourself in the appendix, and also just somewhere along the line, you can inquire from us to get that list of 86 pristine references that I've called out of the medical literature, I've got a database with over 600 references that relate only to menopause and hormones. It's only part of my much larger database that spans my interest in functional medicine and holistic medicine. So what I'm saying here is where that eight to 14 come from. It wasn't based on those two women that were just above nine and just above 12, and were 30 years old. No, it was based on very extensive research into the medical literature and comparing the test results with doses applied and risk factors. And I strongly believe in the eight to eight to 14 reference range, that's determined by adding up the estradiol and estrone micrograms, over treated over 24 hours, in eight to 14 micrograms for the total potent estrogens over 24 hours. That's my goalposts, eight to 14, why am I repeating it? Because I think as you get into this, and you get familiar with these numbers, you're liable to come to a similar conclusion, and see how well that correlates with the safety. And at the same time, enough hormone to alleviate prevent sarcopenia, osteoporosis, cognitive decline, vaginal atrophy, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. In fact, there's one reference in the appendix. It's in the literature that shows that it takes if you if you have a woman, that you have restored the vagina to decent health with with oestrogen what it takes to restore decent health not useful health levels to the vagina, but decent health levels to the vagina. If you accomplish that, you're providing her enough to prevent so many of the consequences of oestrogen insufficiency including arterial issues, a vast majority of cognitive issues. It's wonderful. Not to mention the symptoms that treat a woman to get enough oestrogen to alleviate or reverse vaginal atrophy. And you got it. That's enough, and it doesn't take very much. And that's right down there. At the eighth level. I've seen women have decent vaginal health with six micrograms per 24 hour for long over a long period of time. But I chose eight because not all women below eight will be able to produce a healthy vagina. And thus do so much of the good that we want just from I'm just talking about oestrogen here. Now, interestingly enough, you're going to find that some women are going to titrate into feeling well. And they're going to say that I found my dose doc. And we go ahead and test them and they're coming in above 14, even up to 24. And there are exceptions that I will make will accept something higher than 14 if the other hormones are balanced, and if they have a normal and non dense mammogram. And we also have these women get thermograms Absolutely because we don't want to see any evidence of over stimulation of breast glandular tissue, as reflected in as increased heat. Thus, inflammation in a thermogram thermograms. A very non invasive, very relatively easy thing to do. I'm gonna have more to say about thermograms and how I don't recommend them for routine screening. But I definitely Well, women have to sign an agreement B prior to me treating them that if I asked for a thermogram they'll do it. And so they in order to go above 14, we insist that they have a non non dance mammogram. And you've seen how detailed classification of density and mammograms can get and also a normal thermogram I either not getting overstimulation of breast glandular tissue and for that, when those conditions prevail, we'll accept a number even up to the highest 24 And these are postmenopausal total potent estrogens.
