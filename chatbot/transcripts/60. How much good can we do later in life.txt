I'd like to discuss the hormonal issues of the elderly. And I've always had a diverse practice, all ages. And one thing became apparent to me especially as my parents, in my in laws were ageing, that the kind of difficulties that the elderly women could run into. And it became a major mission of mine to see how much success could we have in reversing some of the changes is dark sarcopenia and osteoporosis and cognitive issues that had developed in my own family. And also, I started realising that, my goodness, one of the most important missions that we're on in treating women and menopause, is preventing these different issues that you've seen me emphasise throughout the story. And then a lot is can we do anything about the issues of the elderly? And the answer is yes. And I just wanted to review that, if we put on this graph to the left the onset of menopause, so this is a lifetime line, and it's beginning at the onset of menopause. And we go all the way to very, very old age. Well, these hormones they keep on having a story in the estrogens for example, they've done one of their major declines at menopause itself, so much so that for example, there's not enough oestrogen to support the creation of an endometrial lining. But that doesn't mean the estrogens have totally tanked at that point. But they do continue to decline over time until a very old age, and I'll demonstrate this for you on laboratory tests. It's extremely low progesterone has been very low ever since ovulation ceased, and it continues at its very low level, it still has a level because there is adrenal production of progesterone and the androgens, they've had a couple possible stories. They could be continuing decline before the onset of menopause and continue on during menopause or they can be stabled in the early years of menopause, or they can even increase slightly as perimenopause is coming to a close and menopause is beginning I've always viewed that as a compensation the body make to produce some extra estradiol out of the testosterone. But as I've stressed before, within 234, or five years, those androgens tank and by the time of menopause, at least five years into menopause. They are low in every woman that I've ever encountered and tested. And then what I'm trying to illustrate here is they continue to decline. So by the time you've got someone in their late 70s and 80s, they are almost zero nil. And to illustrate this another way, the blue bar is the various ages of the selected patients. And the red bar is the level of total potent estrogens in a 24 hour urine hormone test. And this is sorted according to the prevalence of those total potent estrogens. So at the left, the highest level of estrogens exists there. And notice as the older in general people get the more those estrogens decline. And single out those two women right there happens to be my mother and mother and look how low their estrogens are down there. And I'll illustrate this further. And what happens when these estrogens get this low? Well what happens when their women are this old and and there's so many possibilities, including significant cognitive challenge sarcopenia, urinary frequency and nocturia, urgency urinary incontinence, sleep disturbance, lower extremity pain, I mean, there is a long list of possibilities for the elderly women. So there are consequences and that's what I want to point out. So here's an example of a transcribed 24 year on hormone test and this woman is 88 years old. Look at this extra down undetected low, low, none detected undetected and the androgens low, low low. I mean, you've seen these spelled out before these hormones are extremely low. And then here's an 85 year old woman who was quite tired quite feeble. She didn't have any cognitive decline. She was weak enough that she was standing in her kitchen and made a turn, simple turn fell fractured humerus and pelvis. Drum dramatic recuperation from the surgery and rehabilitation. Oh my goodness, this was so consequential such a simple fall. And by the time she started emerging, she had very significant lower extremity pain. Just to point out something the th e plus TF hit HF was five Alpha th F was 1706 You know, at least like to see that above 2020 500 And that was very low. Oh, and interestingly enough, we made her up a transdermal cortisol, or nearly I would give cortef by mouth, but she had GERD and gastritis. So we couldn't do that. So we gave her transdermal cortisol. And, to my utter astonishment, the leg pain, diminished and decreased and disappeared. I can't exactly explain it, but it did. And look at those androgens. I'm going to refer to those in just a little bit with her, I'm going to focus in on the adrenal corticosteroids, and both of these women, there it is, the first woman had also a low sum total of the th, E, th, F and five Alpha THF, one of my favourite ways to evaluate the corticosteroids and I'm gonna show you more about that in future segments here. And also just to point out because this isn't just confined to the ovaries in the adrenals, her TSH was 10.56 At this time, and of course, we address that in our free T four was low, with the low end of normal 0.8. Then this other patient that didn't have any cognitive climb that first patient did, and hurt her sum total of her corticosteroid metabolites was 1706. Because that range of 4000 to 6000. That's what young healthy women have. We don't need them to have that much, but 1706 is very significant. And I'm gonna have a lot to say when I choose to treat the corticosteroids, but that was an obvious one to me. And again, the thyroid issues are very common adrenal and are very hormones Completion can be very dramatic, as I've illustrated with those two tests. Yesterday is progesterone and androgens and corticosteroids. So consider treating all of them. And the earlier the better. And you can run into some challenges with the elderly, because the skin can be an absorption problem. So you can consider cortisol transdermally, or also po and DHEA, and progesterone po much easier. And yeah, the cortef is easier, but should not be used when a patient has GERD or gastritis. And consider even oestrogen po when you just don't think that the women are gonna be able to work with the transdermal is, as in one of those two patients called my mother was not able to put together cognitively, the shaking of the bottle and the transdermal application. So there has been one patient over the course my entire career that I've treated with oral estradiol, and it was my own mother. Think about the bane of the elderly. It's sarcopenia and falling on to osteoporotic bones. And there's bladder issues galore. And there's cognitive decline possible not universal, my mother lived zero incline, it was just totally remarkable. And my own mother did have some cognitive decline, energy decline. I mean, I've shown you the pictures of the muscle decline and the sarcopenia. And of course, the bones, you're very familiar with it. And once again, I'm going to emphasise that that weakness of that levator and i Oh, my goodness, what a loss that is sarcopenia. Yeah, big problem, especially in the lower extremities, but also in the levator AI. And then, of course, the possible challenges to the elderly, to the arteries. And the brain. cognitive decline has a very significant relationship to ovarian hormones. What we've designed because compliance is a little more challenging in the elderly, is we've designed a formula that we call menopause method eldor for women, and it contains bias progesterone, DHEA, testosterone and pregnenolone. We also have an M M elder hyphen s for the sensitive. It's half the dose of these because there are some women who will develop breast tenderness and it comes in both the organic oil suspension and also in solution and one of the carriers. So yeah, you know, it's always risk benefit. And so we use carbopol for the elderly. This is something I'd like to show you. This is my beloved mother in law who could not get out of the chair and remember the almost non existent antigens you had we also gave her androgens galore, which she was very faithful in putting on and this is after several months of androgen treatment. I mean, I'm sorry that I didn't get him before on this one. But it's so remarkable what she is now capable of doing. Watch this. No hands. That's a soft couch and it's low. That's what androgens did for her. Me. It's absolutely remarkable.
