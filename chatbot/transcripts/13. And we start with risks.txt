Let's burrow deeper into the whole subject of risks and benefits. Because menopause medicine has a strong underlying theme of benefits and risks. And here's our mission. How close to zero? Can we help bring risk. And it comes down to you and your patient, and the individual patient that's sitting in front of you. And one thing they have is concerns about what are those risks. And I found it to be true in my practice, that every woman that I felt ever sat at the beginning of menopause to explore it had a small, medium or huge concern about issue at risk. And what I learned early on is, I don't want a woman applying hormones twice a day and thinking, but I probably would create something awful if I do so proactively. For the longest time I have been addressing risk in that first visit. And, you know, there came a time in my practice, in my in my working with menopause, that I had to learn all the way. Okay, what is going on that somebody could risk is hovering, I'm going to have to dive into the medical literature and see what's happening in this is where our authority comes from, it's going to be based upon our own comfort with the subject of risk. And that risk that comfort is going to depend upon our knowledge and our experience. And one backbone of that knowledge is our scientific literature, which is just loaded with great stuff. So let's take that deep dive into that scientific literature. But before we do, I want to give you an overview of an overview of the literature. The subject we're interested in is risk for illness and really grave illness really, in menopause medicine. We're talking breast cancer is the bottom line, what we're mostly concerned about. And I'd like to just looking at it from a bigger perspective, a more inclusive perspective, illness is not caused by the physical body that causes derive is that been saved from adversities of nutrition, toxicity, exercise and stress. And I'd like to add in the great mystery, because there's a lot of people that get ill and we can't easily explain it, but they are ill. And these adversities of nutrition, toxicity, exercise and stress come primarily from our choices, our thoughts, our emotions, our consciousness, our exposures, et cetera, and illnesses, so grave as to be life threatening, they are very significant causes. For example, one of my favourite things, when a patient was curious about well, how did all this come about? I'd say, well, let's pretend. And I point to my wall of my office. And I'd say, let's pretend that we have a video of your whole life that you will photograph from the time you were conceived 24/7 Until this day, and that the editor had a magic button, and he was able to edit out all the good stuff, all the fun, all the good food, all the good exercise, all the good stuff, what would remain all the adversities of nutritional indiscretions, too much or too little exercise toxic exposures, and the elephant in everybody's room, and adverse or exaggerated response to stress which triggers the biology of fight or flight, and ultimately depletes those hormones and contributes to inflammation. We'd see that in this edited video of someone's whole life, we'd see the causes laid out there. And what I'd like to assert, and not only just flying by the seat of my pants, from what I've treasured is a deep dive into the medical literature is that hormones don't cause illness. However, if something goes arise with hormone, they're such potent, powerful chemicals, that there's going to be trouble and insufficiency or excess of hormones, there's going to be a problem. And I'd like to underline once again, as I began to introduce to you, insufficiency in the elderly is far more universal and adverse than excess. Now, our medical literature happens to be mixed in, I can't find it to be definitive, you can build a case for Yes, or build a case for No, if I do this, I'm going to die. If I don't do this, I'm going to die. The plus and minus of any single subject in medical literature that you want. And I remember very clearly the Senior Medical School medical literature course that we had to take for six months at the University of Michigan. And at first I was Oh God, more academics. And then boy, once I started it, I saw the wisdom of the designers of our curriculum, because they helped us they wanted us to see and understand the medical literature and be able to sort out the junk from the great science in there. And, you know, it took quite a learning to be able to do that intelligently. And here's the challenges in the literature. There's such a variation in the quality of the science that that presented there. And there's the possible heavy footprint of monetary motivation. We all know this. And then the way science has been done in medicine, is there's a focus upon one or two factors is if there was one or two variables, how someone got ill, and how they're going to get well. And this derives from the whole approach to medicine through pharmaceutical medications. And, but this is never going to work. Because all illness is multifactorial, there is a multitude of factors that go into any one being, you know, so just try and zero a down to one issue are so like cholesterol, for example. It just gets totally unclear about what is the true role. And the same is true in the world of hormones, we can zero these things down to one or two issues. And like I was saying evidence exists for yes in any particular subject you want and you can have a tremendous amount of evidence that exists for now and that very same subject. Also, in the medical literature, and especially in the menopause literature, there is unclear nomenclature. For example, they will be talking about oestrogen, but they haven't fully defined it in many instances. When they use the word oestrogen or HRT, what are they referring to? Very commonly as it's to Premarin, horse urine derived equine estrogens conjugated equine, oestrogen si ease or combined si ease which is prempro, the adding in the Madras oxy progesterone acetate, the Provera are those the estrogens they're talking about? Are they talking about bioidentical hormones? And is the progesterone that they use that word for? Are they actually referring to a progestin? And there's a world of difference in those molecules between bioidentical progesterone, the molecule that is produced by the FET, female ovaries and adrenal glands, and progestins. And you know, you will, if you don't know it already, I'll soon point out that it was the progestins that were the problem in the Women's Health Initiative study. And then there's always the issue of route of administration, because there can be a big difference in safety, between oral administration of oestrogen or testosterone, for example, or topical administration, and then there's all that oral that has to do with going through first pass through the liver versus no paths. So what it comes down to, I'm not going to be able to be ultimately definitive on the subject of risk for you. The final answers are not yet in and my own assertion is they can never be until we can get multifactorial, which is the course there are workings underway to accomplish that very thing in medical studies. However, with all those caveats, I would like to say that there is a tremendous amount of valuable information in our medical literature to consider and that's what this preface has been about.
