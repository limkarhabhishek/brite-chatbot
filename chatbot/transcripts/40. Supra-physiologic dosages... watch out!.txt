Now I'm taking these women, I'm resorting them. And I'm comparing them the purple bar is the dosage they were taking compared with the red bar, which is the total potent oestrogen. So on the y axis to the left, you can see the micrograms per 24 hour urines, and just slightly different scales. I showed it before and on the right, you see the milligrammes of estradiol, Quilon per day and purple, and let's compare them and once again, I'm putting in these parameters, and here's the average parameter of 1.7 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, this is relating to the purple dosages, and I just put in the parameters of eight to 24, and the total potent estrogens. And what are these outliers do? Where did they come from? And they, by the way, did not include the original 54. I show you and showed you in the previous graph. I've added these three because they showed up with total potent estrogens that are very high, and these three women did have their period return. So that's why I'm adding them separately. And look at the dosages are very high. That's referring to the total potent estrogens. And the other thing is that the total potent estrogens are very high. Much higher than that oestrogen dominant 27 year old as illustrated by that dotted horizontal line. Now, here's women who had high dosages, but look at that, their total potent potent estrogens were uniformly low, quite low, some of them so the dose regimen of those three that are to the right, those outliers. Let's take a look at that and there's their initials, and this is the amount of milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, who they were being treated with per day. In fact, they happen to be treated with pure estradiol, eight milligrammes of estradiol, eight milligrammes of estradiol, equivalent. That's what eight milligrammes of Ester dollars is, equates to, man, that's a lot higher than my upper limit of 2.6. And then it only goes higher, to 10 and to 12. And those other two patients, these women were being treated with exceedingly high estradiol levels are same as milligrammes of estradiol, equivalent, much higher than what I would ever dream of doing. And by the way, when you start doing something like that, the elephant in the room becomes the sex hormone binding globulin, because that verb, their bodies have got to protect themselves. Now, I didn't, I don't have sex hormone binding globulin levels on these women because we did a very radical thing with them. Once we discovered they came to me they were not feeling well, even though they were on this certain regimen. And what were their total potent oestrogen, super physiologic. The first woman had total potent estrogens of 125 micrograms per 24 hours, where I say the 27 year old who was oestrogen dominant My God, she was up less than 40. This woman has 125 micrograms, and the second woman had 63. And the third woman had 61. The reference range maximum extended reference range that I accept, is it's really eight to 24. And just for curiosity, look at the oestrogen quotients. On these women that were given that much yesterday, well, first 1.44, that's a lot less than the two to four range I liked and the second one 1.2 1/3 woman 0.69, you cannot give your estradiol and expect to get oestrogen quotient, and I totaled up to total metabolites, because we didn't want to see some kind of metabolically metabolising issue going on to drive those levels up. And that can happen. But But since it's not happening there, these are simply overdose, they're super physiologic. In fact, that's what it took to get these women's period to restore at the age of 6156, and 63. Just to put this in context and perspective, remember, we're dealing with ranges of 0.8 to 2.6. Treating wise, and testing wise, we will accept up to 24, but we prefer eight to 14. And then in order to account for the super physiologic I have to extend this bar graph. So I don't have any more room to the right. So I'm going to put it on the line below. It's just picking up and look at this. We're bringing the treatment numbers up to eight 910 11. And when the 24 hour urine micrographs for 24 hours total Putin estrogens 5670 to 8.8 and let's we're see where these ladies landed between eight and 12 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. I already showed you that, on that spreadsheet, they're associated with that previous chart. And as far as total potent estrogens to get menses through continual return, they had to be way in the Super physiologic level to do it. In other words, you're not just restoring youthful levels to get out Like menopause, a woman's period to return or to or to sustain. You got to provide three to eight times the upper limit of normal to get them to sustain Is that okay?
