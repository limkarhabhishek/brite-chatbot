I'd like to review thyroid testing with you. And just to review the basic anatomy physiology, we've got the hypothalamus, which is secreting a hormone called thyrotropin, releasing hormone TRH. That goes down to the terior pituitary, and that is releasing TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone. And that has a positive effect on the thyroid gland. The more stimulating hormone, the more T four and T three that that thyroid gland is producing. And then that will affect the blood levels, where it's going to the thyroid hormones are going to meet up with thyroid binding globulin, TBG. And then its distribution to the peripheral cells of the body, the T four which gets converted to T three in the cytoplasm of the cell. And then there's a feedback system that the more peripheral tissue is receiving T four and T three, it's going to suppress the anterior pituitary and thus less thyroid stimulating hormone is going to be produced. And another clinical corollary of that is if you have, you're administering too much T four and T three year course, going to suppress anterior pituitary output of thyroid stimulating hormone, you also suppress the hypothalamus. And interestingly enough is a sidebar, if you have too much T four and T three too much thyroid hormone, you're going to increase that sh B G, which is going to bind up some other stuff besides the thyroid. And if we look at thyroid testing, we want to look at the basic hormones The thyroid is and there's free T four or thyroxin there is Tria or thyroid in and I'm just reviewing what we've spoken about in the past. And then there's assessing and reverse T three as a basic client in all my patients. And certainly if I'm treating someone with thyroid hormones and repeat testing, and then you know these chemical configurations are pretty fascinating to me to look at. There's a thyroxin molecule sitting in the centre of a thyroid binding globulin, my or my isn't that amazing? And then for thyroid testing, I'm going to review with you the routines that I do, I've already said it many times, I always get a free T for Free T three TSH and reverse T three, and I don't get anything else, unless I suspect autoimmune thyroiditis as it relates to the thyroid. And then we also always get a sex hormone binding globulin, and I'm including it with thyroid testing because excessive thyroid hormone can increase that sex hormone binding globulin, as I've said several times. In addition, there's times in which I'm going to get anti thyroid antibodies, for example, the thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and anti thyroid globulin antibody. Because thyroiditis exists, as you know, and you know, it's not that uncommon. And if I see erratic treatment programmes, or I see these spikes, and someone who's having a rough time with hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism, I'm going to quickly spring for the no thyroid antibodies just to make sure that we don't have an autoimmune situation going on or immune situation going on. And then it's possible to evaluate thyroid binding globulin, I haven't had the personal need to do so. And then evaluating progesterone levels. Because what I mentioned with progesterone, I mean, it takes us back to a woman who wants to know is she ovulating? So one way you get to know if you're ovulating. That's pretty reliable, is do you have regular cycles every 28 days, every 27, every 29, something like that, they're highly likely to be regularly ovulating. And here's another way, you know, if you're taking your basal temperature every day, and you're graphing it out on a graph paper, because these jumps are not huge. You're gonna see a rise in temperature midcycle. And I've already explained this, why do you get that rise in, in temperature mid cycle if you ovulate? Is it because you get it? No, it's because you're getting a surge of progesterone. And progesterone augments the relationship to thyroid and thyroid receptor sites. So in order to get optimal function out of thyroid hormone, you need adequate progesterone is Dr. Lee was very quick to point out. That's why I get progesterone at times. And of course, I often have one because I'm getting 24 hour urine hormone test, and any the perimenopausal women, usually by the third visit. And then as far as the timing of drawing the blood, I've gotten very uniform about that. In fact, I always say to my patients, they either come into the office or they go to the laboratory draw station in the morning. Now we all know that you don't need to get a fasting blood glucose for many of the analytes but just to simplify it for my patients so that they had this emblazoned in their mind going fast. I'm going fasting, get a fasting blood draw, get a morning blood draw fasting first thing in the morning. And so that became absolutely 100% routine in my practice. And it wasn't having to deal with any of the variables that are related to time of day or meals. I know some things are supposedly not affected by meals, but hey, not a bad I stood by it and I liked it. And then I always had took out some of the variables. What I do say is they do want you to drink water from midnight on Absolutely. We don't want him to get dehydrated you get abnormal hematocrit, you can often tell that amount of grits seems a little too high. You wonder if they got dehydrated. And I'll ask them did you drink water? Like I was suggesting to you? No, no, no, I didn't have anything. So I thought that would be easier to remember. So you know, water only and yes, please do drink water from midnight on and no to everything else by mouth. No coffee, no toothpaste there, sugar and a lot of these toothpaste, I want to see their best numbers possible. No medications, unless there's some absolutely essential medicine. But if they're on thyroid, absolutely. Don't take that thyroid that morning, until you have your blood drawn. And of course, to assess the thyroid, if they're on thyroid medication, you want to be sure they haven't gone or erratic in their treatment of taking the actual thyroid medication. So you want to have them to have it taken it for at least the preceding five days without any missing of any doses, but not the morning when they wake up. They can bring that thyroid pill with them and take it soon as their blood is drawn. So if I'm thyroid hormones, ideally you do it at the time of the thyroid dosages have been steady, not changing doses. And the more the merrier. Because it takes a TSH I've heard up to three weeks to adjust. So you know what I usually say to my patients, I says I want you to note, if you like this thyroid hormone, and if you've isolated your way, and maybe had to go to overdose, and back down, I'll specify that upcoming here. But once you think you've landed, wait three weeks. So I want to be certain as best as I count that the TSH has actually normalised and come into equilibrium with the whole thyroid situation. And what's happening when you're a woman a patient is being treated and peroid hormone and you're not having you're getting a fasting blood draw. Really you're looking at the vapour trails. Let's put this in perspective. You're looking at what their own internal thyroid hormone output is. And the vapour trails of what's left over after 24 hours, or shall we say after three months of 24 hours? What's that third level so this is not a 100% accurate amount of measurement and so your TSH becomes a fairly important in there and I know that there's been controversy around the TSH a no controversy to me. The one thing is is I I'll admit, as I think that I've seen hypothyroid people when their TSH is normal, but in my own personal experience is that TSH is a good test. Especially when you see a high TSH, above five, and then you treat the drops. I mean, that mechanism is still in place. But I get a free T three and I get a free T four and a reverse T three because I feel like I need all of these analytes to really feel more confident in the laboratory analysis of thyroid. Now in general, if you get a lower than normal free T four and a free T three, you're probably going to see an elevated TSH if that pituitary is functioning decently. Yes, you can have pituitary malfunctions where your free T four and your free T three dropped below acceptable ranges acceptable in the sense that they support net normal metabolism for example, and you have a normal TSH well Why'd that happen? That's a pituitary issue. And those issues do occur. I've definitely had them I had I'm thinking immediately into my mind comes this patient I've had for 20 years she was severely hypothyroid and the best we could tie it down in a pituitary accident that occurred from hitting the soccer ball she was an excellent soccer player and batted that ball around with her head many times including got knocked out had a concussion on the soccer field. So pituitary issues do happen. But my I've seen a lot of reliability that TSH and its relationship to the free hormones that are out there. And let's look at the opposite effect where you you're looking to thyroid blood tests that shows free T four and free T three being elevated. Above the norms you're gonna most likely see a suppressed TSH and you might even see an elevated reverse T three which again, underscores the importance of a baseline when you're treating someone
