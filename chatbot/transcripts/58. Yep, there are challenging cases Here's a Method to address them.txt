I want to give you a method to address some of your challenging cases because this comes up so often with the physicians that I consult with. Here's a commonly found hormone treatment transition case. Esther is 50 years old on prem Pro. She could have been on any hormone for that matter, but she happened to be on prem Pro for 10 years. She was doing fairly well, but she wanted to try bioidentical hormones because of all that she had learned about them. And the plan that I follow is the PT p r x after she has received her new bioidenticals. That means I've written her a prescription for the new bioidenticals that we're going to put her on. For example, the starting dose I use all the time is by us, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and the organic oils and progesterone 200 milligrammes familiar when she's actually picked up the hormones from the pharmacy or have had them shipped to her for my prescription. When she's got them in her hand. I have her totally DC the Premarin or the prempro or whatever hormone she's on, totally DC until in a day, or days or weeks, the longest time that a woman had to wait my practice with three weeks, she starts developing her first symptom of hormonal deficiency. That's when she pulls out the bias and progesterone and starch her her dose determination process. Like I said, she this woman was on prempro, this approach works for anything and everything ovarian, a woman could be on, including a different bioidentical regimen, you get into difficulty and you want to know how to handle it just start from scratch. And PTP is pull the plug. No dosage, I often joke with women, I say, where are your new biassed and your new progesterone and a holster? And the moment you get your first symptom, put it on, but don't put it on before you get to the first symptom. And what does that illustrate that they're not going to get a symptom until they've drained significant amount of hormone from their body because remember, these hormones are fat soluble, and they're going to accumulate in the body adipose tissue. So just because you stop the dose here, does not mean you're going to develop a symptom five minutes later, no, you're going to develop a symptom for as long as it takes for the hormones to diffuse out of the adipose tissue, get into general circulation and be excreted. Here's another case. It's Melanie. She's 53 years old. She's five foot four, she's 140 pounds, little overweight. They're highly sensitive, oh, we highly sensitive. You all probably now have encountered highly sensitive women. I would just be so amazed if you hadn't. And she was previously on oral oestrogen and progesterone tro and she changed the organic oils by us 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20 and progesterone. 200 milligrammes plus, because this woman had very significant sleep issues, she was put on 125 milligrammes by her physician, or progesterone Po, which really cleared up her sleep issues and helped her feel more relaxed. Now, that's humongous. I mean, you help a woman clear up her sleep issues, you are really accomplishing something, and the bias goes that she was on she was on one drop in the morning, which is point four four milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, and four drops HS, that's for a total of 1.76 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent in the evening, and that's for a grand total of 2.2 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. Well, she reported that her brain is better, and she had less body aches, but the natural hot flashes are still strong and disruptive. She was afraid to stop the hormones primarily because of a pensively to bleed when she stops the progesterone and for the sleep disturbance to recur. So this occasion I was careful I wanted to pull the plug, but it could be that as sensitive as she is, or bias dosages too high, especially the HS spiky dose. So ordinarily, I would DC both the bias and the progesterone would not not with this patient for one thing, big clue around highly sensitive. And even the progesterone could be excessive, because remember, progesterone can compete with oestrogen for oestrogen receptor sites and also with a history of oral estrogens. If she did not already have an sh B, G, I would get one right away. So clinical step number one, get that sh BG. Now I was told by the physician that I was consulting with on this case, that this patient was very challenging, and she was pretty much at her wit's end. That's significant additional information we do not have unlimited. Let's figure this out time with every woman. We've got a lot of time with most of our patients to sort through some of the challenges that can arise. But well, I already got the clue that she was at her wit's end so I Do an additional thing if the woman can afford it. And I would have her pick up a 24 hour urine hormone test if that's feasible, and begin collecting immediately and do the timing from the time she's starting the hormone collection, this is a more thorough strategy, because you Your days of trying to figure this out, there may be more of them. And if you've got the more information, it's going to serve you greatly. So this is an example of a 24 hour urine hormone test I bring in to sort out a tough case, and especially in a woman who's, you know, been having a hard time for quite a while, and then I would ordinarily have her DCR hormones as soon as she peed her last drop into the jug, but I would not have her DC, that progesterone, because I don't want to immediately jump into getting into a sleep disturbance that can disrupt her even more. And she's a very sensitive patient, the next step and I like her to email me daily. I may not respond, but the info that I get helps really keep me online and connected to that woman's process. And I tell you, we learn something day by day, you have one idea one day you implement that idea. And then the patient is connecting with you and describing various things that you asked her to describe to you on a daily email, and you are going to stay connected to her and you're going to solve it sooner or later. It always works. It's micromanaging it staying really in a lot of contact with that patient, and it will become apparent to you. And if not consult with me because you're members of the menopause method and you can consult with me anytime that we can set up for no charge. Now if she starts to feel better in some time after the seeing the biassed then we learn something especially if she's has less hot flashes. What does that tell us? If she stopped the bias, she's still taking the progesterone and she starts feeling better and getting less hot flashes. It tells us she was an overdose. Once again I micromanage and I have a theory we try it out and see what follows sooner or later. We always solve it
