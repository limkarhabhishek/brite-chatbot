One of the things that I think is very important in your actual consultation with women have, I've been clear enough as a provider to discuss the subject of risk to where what happened to me is I explored the whole subject of risk over years and in very significant depth is I got it, I feel very strong about the benefit, especially when doing a very, very careful approach to women and menopause. And that's what I'm, that's one of my goals is to transmit that to women, they don't necessarily need to know every single detail, or know go to medical school to figure out menopause. But what they what does matter to them is what they can sense in me. And then any, I can point them to references as well, to help them settle their mind. Because I want them if they're going to embark upon treating them being treated with hormones, I want them to have a certain measure of internal safety that when they're rubbing on their skin, they can say, you know, this is good for me. And I've gone through this whole subject, and I understand risk. And this feels beneficial to me, that's the goal. So that that's why I'm saying, will you be clear enough with your patients so that you can feel that moment where they go, I feel good about this, because many of them will come in with expressed or unexpressed concerns. And I want them by the time they're walking out the door in that first visit, to feel good about it. And if they don't, if I sense there's too much fear, or more fear than feels appropriate to me. I'll say to them, Why don't we pause? Why don't really respect that you're concerned about this. And we don't have to act today. There's no emergency and treating menopause, I suggest that you go out and you learn more. And I'm going to point you to some resources, which I always send people to my book, which goes into the subject of risk in quite depth, and has 86 of the pristine resource references that for them that relate to risk and menopause and all the subjects of menopause in that book. And, you know, let them go out because you know, if a woman has excessive amount of fear, she could be the very woman that isn't conscious of it. But she has a pre existing breast cancer that's got oestrogen positive receptor sites, and could respond by faster growth, to hormonal treatments. So this I'll go deeper into this. But the bottom line is if a woman feels uncomfortable midway through that visit or three quarters through that visit, my goal is not to get them to that prescription. My goal is to respect exactly what's going on in them. And put some give them some time and space to figure it out to sleep on it so to speak. And what I found is women do come to the optimal conclusion for themselves as best as possible. Now there is the whole subject of informed consent, because we're dealing with risk here. And I made a personal decision and you'll make your own you're going to make you're going to choose for your practice what feels best. I've seen informed consents, from other practices, women have brought them to me, my God, I just wouldn't want to hand that to a woman. It's just the practitioner trying to absolve themselves of any risk whatsoever. And so they throw it all on the on the woman which may be true or may not be true. But at any rate, that was too scary for a woman, in my opinion, to sign anything like that. So I've never done an informed consent, except with one exception. And that is I have treated women and have women in my practice to this day that had a history of breast cancer. And for a variety of reasons, we will discuss this. This is definitely one of the more challenging situations that can occur because you will be asked if you practice menopause medicine by women who've had breast cancer that they want the treatment. So I'll describe how I do the informed consent with them. Now risks can be specific such as increased breast density on mammogram happens to be a risk factor for breast cancer. And toxic exposures can be risk factors and oestrogen dominance. A long time prevalence of oestrogen or overdose of oestrogen can be a problem. And of course, there's the genetic propensities, example BRCA. And coagulation is a risk or there can be general kinds of risks such as frail health that are based on many underlying issues. The bottom line and menopause medicine is risk for breast cancer, breast cancer can be managed. There are many, many women especially more time goes on that are being successfully treated for breast cancer and are far or well beyond five years. out in Bravo, but any of you have dealt with breast cancer, you know that you wish it never happened. And so, what else matters? Yes, there's endometrial cancer but not too hard to detect and not too hard to deal with. Yes, who wants hysterectomy? But my goodness, it is a cure curing action for most no mutual cancers especially when caught early. So that's the bottom line. We want to look at breast cancer risk.
