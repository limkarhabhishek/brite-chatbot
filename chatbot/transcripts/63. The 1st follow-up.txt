Now I want to walk you into one of the technical way that we can address these hormones and get the prescription just right get the milligrammes per millilitre, just right in and really involves the initial follow up consultations, and our beloved dose calculators. I think you may recall that I said previously in this presentation, details to follow, here's more details coming at you. Well, you've gone through that first visit, and you've reviewed their whole history, perhaps with a questionnaire, you've done, what physical exam you're going to do, or you've gotten the results from their local physician is doing that physical exam, female exam, you've looked at all their lab tests, you've ordered new lab tests, and they walk out the door with a prescription. And they they've been working this prescription after that first consultation. And now you're at that second consultation, which, you know, optimally occurs in about the five week mark. If they're using the organic oils, they have enough oil in that bottle to dose determine, and that'll take them five or six weeks. That's about it. So we usually schedule at that second consultation five weeks, and when they walk out the door, that first consultation, and there's things to do just prior to that consultation. So they're entering into that consultation. And in our practice, that can often take place over the phone, I mean, had a lot of folks that flew in from out of state. And I found that that first initial visit was very important by the phone and now it's, it's fine by telemedicine, I'm now learning. But that second compensation can easily be done on the phone and telemedicine. And just prior to that consultation, we email to the patient will link to a follow up questionnaire. And so all the information you need, and to document you're going to want to document it but you're going to need it, you're going to want to know a lot of things about that patient for that second consultation, that's going to help you determine whether you need to tweak the dose, change the prescription, see how they're doing, it's a wonderful time to check in with them. Every patient gets a follow up questionnaire prior to every single follow up consultation. So even if they email us and say, you know, I'm running into a hurdle. And I know I've had my second consultation, but can we can I get five minutes or 10 minutes with the doctor on the phone? Absolutely. And of course, we tell our patients upfront that they do pay for my time, but it's gonna save money if they if they keep asking me the questions that they get as they get them. Well, even before one of those brief consultations, we send them a follow up questionnaire, you'll see why it's the information you want. Now you can go to www dot menopause method.com Select for medical professionals go into the members area, because you are members and go to the onboarding videos, which is going to spell out how to access those questionnaires, how to email those questionnaires, we've taken quite a bit of care to make this as easy as we possibly can for you. So you can get a questionnaire to your patient. And you can have your own HIPAA secure website, or you can download their HIPAA secure form. As a PDF for your medical records, you go to the onboarding videos and the questionnaires and you'll learn how to access them yourself. And once you go through that process, all you have to do is say your patient here, here's the link, and you can put that link on your website. So they don't know that they have anything to do with us. And really, we are actually isolated from that process. You get your own portal, HIPAA approved, HIPAA secure, those are two different things. Both of them, give you the full HIPAA blessing. And then what do you do during that consultation while you review the questionnaire, and you're gonna see how that patient is doing. And occasionally on that second visit, the patient's going to feel so she's really she's feeling great. And that's terrific. And that happens not all the time. And usually she's going to require a minor tweaking of dosages, even if she feels great, and we'll show you how to do that. You may need to tweak those dosages because you have to get the number of drops correct. And we'd like to standardise those two, five drops. And then with a eight and a half millilitre prescription. That means you're dispensing a one month supply of hormones for her and then how do you make those changes? If she needs us somewhat of a tweak to that prescription, that initial prescription? Well, you go to the members area and you go to the calculators. We're going to teach you how to do the calculators in great details, but I'm going to review them with you right now. Let's say that they come to your office and they feel pretty good. And then the questionnaire is revealed to you exactly what they're on. And then you've pulled up the second consultation calculator because as I've explained before, we want to conform to the five drops for bias two in the morning and three in the evening. We want to conform to the 60s absent progesterone that's optimal. And that also allows you in the compounding pharmacist to be prescribing one month supply and not bumping into those excessive increases that can take place. If for example, you're on one drop in the morning and one drop in the evening because you've created a super strong formulation of bias to to accomplish that. And I've reviewed that already, and these calculators will help you with the next dose. So let's look at that top part of that calculator. And these are the only fields that can be changed in this particular calculator.
