So let's select the next drop down of progesterone. She was on 200 milligrammes per millilitre. Once you select progesterone this calculator knows what the menopause method is, we taught it magically. So, in auto answer is the 200 milligrammes per millilitre pin. The ratio of course, is not applicable, and that turns out to be 8.7 milligrammes and progesterone per drop, and then you want to fill out how well how many drops did she dose determine along her path and let's say she made it up to four drops 34.8 Total milligrammes of transdermal progesterone per day. And then you choose the symptoms, are there any symptoms related to progesterone, and lo and behold, this patient reported, she's still got a little bit trouble falling asleep. She certainly didn't wake up groggy. Maybe you want to increase that amount, that's probably the experiment we're going to run but meanwhile, it's going to translate this, the four drops and it's taking into account the minor insufficiency, so she's bumped her up to six drops, and it's changed the milligrammes per millilitre, and that will give her a month's supply of and a slight increase in the amount of progesterone. So we have increased the dosage, we've decreased the milligrammes per millilitre, we've increased the dosage, and this calculation is done automatically just by entering those three choosable boxes on the left in the starting prescription that she's on. And then look at the comparison there, they should have gone up from 34.8 up to 43.5. That's a minor increase. They're all applied H s and usually to the inner thighs or abdomen or even the breast sometimes and we've reviewed where the optimal areas to apply progesterone actually are. And then you click on that and you've just added something to this prescription. You notice there's three lines that have now developed before the bias prescription and this is what they're saying menopause method oils, progesterone, 166 milligrammes per millilitre, a naff millilitres, Sig six draps HS, these calculators are what is the optimum way to go. That's why we develop them. And they're the optimal way to go for people doing the menopause method. If you've gone so far as to subscribe and go through the amount of inflammation what's the purpose of this whole method to do everything so exquisitely elegant and accurate, and every step of the checklist way, that we reduce the risk to women as close to zero as we can get it. And we honour the woman, the physician, and we also have some respect and support for the compounding pharmacist without whom we would not be doing this work. And then you can print this and I want to show you another progesterone example different than the progesterone example I just showed you. Let's say that the starting RX is what it always is progesterone. 200. milligrammes and this woman made it up to seven drops in her first month of going home with her prescriptions and trying it out. And let's say she still had a minor insufficiency. In other words, she wasn't getting enough transdermal you're where you're going to have to increase the drops. And this will usually result in an excessive amount of oil seven drops in one fell swoop, or going higher. I mean, I have had women who've done it, but about this time, if they're not getting alleviation those progesterone symptoms or testing ultimately shows you that she's not getting enough, you're gonna get this message, which may be time to switch to trans vaginal, and see the notes below. And there's the notes below that popped up. As you switch to other intra vaginal, you begin with three drops at night because you could get better absorption through that vagina of the 200 milligrammes per millilitre, or you might want to embark upon oral progesterone, and you start the dose determination, if you remember with 25 milligrammes HS or some we start with 50, so you write the prescription, and you schedule the second follow up consultation, which happens to be the third visit for four to five weeks, hence, you're scheduling that third consultation. And at the time of that second visit, that patient can walk out the door with 24 hour urine hormone kits, because you can have the laboratory ship you as many as you want to have in stock, so you can just hand it to the patient on the way out the door. Or if you're doing this by telemedicine or by phone consultation, you can have the lab ship the kit directly to her. And so you just send an email to the lab, they'll ship the kit, and you instruct the patient that if she feels very well, then she has to complete and ship the kit to the lab 10 days prior to the next scheduled consultation. So she submits that 10 days before by the time of the third consultation and you're going to have the test results. Also a reminder the patient should take her hormones religiously for at least a week before plus during the urine collection time. This is the great advantage of the 24 hour urine on one test. You get a real time evaluation of how much is actually making Get into her body. And so you sure want her to be taking it and I caution my patients on this I don't want them to do what sometimes they do some of them do is they're not religious, they're a little erratic, they they'll forget a night nighttime dose. Well, at least for the testing, we want them to follow the exact instructions are the method, which is take your progesterone every night and take your by SBI ID and don't leave any doses out. And if you've left, if you forgotten a dose or two, no, no foul. Just start day one of the five days minimum prior to the testing. And the day after that first drop out. We want prior five days prior to the test collection of the urine. And also course you take all hormones exactly like you do during the urine collection. Now the laboratory instructions give a different option where you will meet the oral hormones, but that's not the option I want my patients to select. You'll discover for yourself what you want. And I'll have more to say about that. If she's not feeling optimal, hold off on the test in hold off on the scheduling of the consultation. Or if she's not feeling significantly non optimal. schedule a consultation but hold off on the test. Because you can learn from her how she's doing and you'll get an idea how you may want to tweak the hormone dosages just on a phone consultation. Ah yes, we do admit that we're walking into territory that is not for the faint of heart. As these photographs illustrate
