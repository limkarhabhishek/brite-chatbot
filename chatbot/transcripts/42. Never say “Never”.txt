Throughout this teaching, I have emphasised what I consider to be a very important principle in dosing with estrogens, and that is not too little. Because if you go too low, you're not going to protect the bones or the vagina, let alone the arteries or the brain and not too high because excessive dosages put a woman at risk for breast glandular cell proliferation. In a young woman breast glandular cell proliferation occurs every single month in preparation for possible implantation and the ability to develop the breast for lactation begins every single cycle. And of course, if she does not impregnate, then the whole process reverses itself the additional breast glandular cells that proliferated through cell division in mitosis, they go undergo apoptosis once a month, a woman's breasts get fuller with additional breast glandular cells as part of what makes them fuller. And then if she doesn't impregnate, they get less fall proliferation once a month mitosis. Well, I'm a strong proponent of not using oestrogen doses so robust that you get proliferation like you're doing a young woman. In fact, if this represents the range of estrogens, this would be the low end for women. This would be the upper end for women, because women vary so much, there is a range, how much they need to menstruate, then the proper dose for menopausal women is right there right below that amount. For most every woman and that way, she won't get breast glandular cell proliferation, and at the same time, she'll be able to protect your vagina and protect her bones. Now, are there exceptions in medicine? Have you ever run across any exceptions? Let me tell you a story. I'm sitting down at the National Academy of Science to present on a panel to protect compounded bioidentical hormones, and to give my presentation, and I had done research and other physicians who were on the panel that I was going to present. And I learned that one of them was on very high dosages of estrogens enough to keep her period going. And as she's sitting down, we've got about two minutes before our panel begins, she smiles at me. And I look at her and I introduce myself and I say are you going to tell them about the protocol you're on that says you've sustained your periods, and she said winked at me. She blinked at me and said no. And in her presentation, she did not she just described her own opinions about how to treat women with compounded bioidentical hormones. She and I went out to lunch, delightful woman, and she's 65 and her son joined us. And she told me this story. When she was in her early 50s. She started to have challenges with cognition. She wasn't thinking clearly. And she was staring right into the face of her mother had developed dementia. As an ad her mother's sister, her this this woman's aunt, both of them had developed dementia. And here she is a practising physician concerned that she's about to lose her career and loser loser ability to think. And she knew that there was a link between estrogens and cognition. So she started treating herself with estrogens and she gave herself a certain amount, she started to clear up a little bit, she gave herself a little more, she started to clear up even more, and she kept on increasing that dose until she cleared up. And what she found that she needed doses so robust as to restore her period. So in medicine, you never say never, never say never. I didn't say boo. I had tears in my eyes here is a living human being a physician Nola, is that restored her cognition. And what did she do? She had to use the dosage is so robust that she restored her period at the same time. I didn't say boo, I didn't mention sh BG I didn't I just I just was touched, that she had been able to restore her thinking. And there's always a way to deal with any single case. I mean, in the menopause method, what we recommend that you do is if you run into one of these situations, because when I define the parameters between eight and 14 micrograms per 24 hour of total potent estrogens, I defined it from the medical literature as the enough to protect the bones and the vagina. I did not say It will also be enough to protect the brain. Because in later in the presentations, especially in the appendix, the amount needed to protect the brains can be a little bit can be that same amount, or some women require more robust dosages. And the medical literature points that out that there's some women that really needs substantial estrogens to restore their cognition. Now, there's many other moving parts. As Dr. Dale Bredesen has outlined beautifully in his book called The End of Alzheimer's. There's so many different possibility that relate to cognitive decline, even dementia, even Alzheimer's. But in a woman, you begin with those estrogens as this doctor did, and what can you do? You can monitor her breasts through consecutive mammograms because that's your concern that you're going to overstimulate breast glandular tissue. You can monitor her breasts through mammography, and even more sophisticated imaging studies. You can do ultrasound, and you can do thermography. And for us, if a woman's on robust oestrogen doses. thermography is an automatic imperative, because we don't want to see increased heat in breasts and there's always there's quite a few things that you can do. So in medicine, you never say never. I never although I've declared over and over again that we want to keep most of the oestrogen amount in the urine between eight and 14 micrograms per 24 hours of the totem pole in estrogens. There are exceptions. And when you go above 14, you monitor those breasts, as always, but you're even more rigorous, including going all the way to thermogram
