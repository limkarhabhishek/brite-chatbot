As an introduction to this, the bedrock of bioidentical hormone medicine for decades has there has been a prevailing method teaching and practice that I've very much been a part of, in which we've recommended dose determination by titration. How well I remember my quantitative chemistry lab where we used to get things out to three zeros, four zeros, it was really remarkable. And now we transfer that method, so to speak, to applying bioidentical topicals to the skin. Well, the basic premise a dose determination by titration is the start with a lowest dose gradually increase until symptoms of hormonal insufficiency are alleviated. While backing dosage down, if symptoms of hormonal excess occur, not too much, and not too little. Yet, I want to look at some cases. In fact, 50 cases that I took of my previous last period of time, there was actually 51 women who had titrated to satisfaction. And I've defined based on my analysis of the medical literature, what hormone testing parameters I consider to be optimal ranges of titration endpoint that bring a woman into the maximal amount of safety, reducing her risk, and at the same time provides sufficient hormones to really address the multitude of physiologic and anatomical problems that can develop with insufficient hormones over the years and the test values. I begin with the some of estradiol the most potent oestrogen and oestrogen which is about 80, percentage potent, and I call that the total potent estrogens and the parameters. The goalposts, ideally, is to bring a woman somewhere between eight and 14 micrograms of those total potent estrogens for 24 hours. That's the criteria. Let's look at these 51 women who had titrated to symptom alleviation, they basically felt fine. Well, here's the hormone test results 27% tested within the optimal range, they had titrated to symptom alleviation. And they had tested within the optimal range 27% However, 26%, tested above the optimal range of 14 micrograms per 24 hours, they had titrated, to symptom alleviation. And it turned out from my perspective, they were not on what I would call a long term safe dose, they titrated over the top and 47% it titrated to symptom alleviation, but they tested below the optimal range. And throughout the course of this menopause method. I'll show you how I arrived at what optimal range comparing the scientific literature as it relates to osteoporosis, vaginal health, cognitive health, et cetera, how I arrived at these optimal ranges, but 47% had tested below the optimal range, and in thus, eight less than eight micrograms per 24 hours. Oh, titration doesn't work. 27% of the time, does not a method make. How could this be so the women were satisfied? Well, the symptoms of overdose are pretty reliable. Oh my goodness. 75% of the women will feel breast tenderness or breast pain, if they've titrated up to excessive oestrogen dosage. And, roughly speaking, it's a guess 25% of my patients do not detect it by breast symptoms, or by any symptoms, they don't detect the overdose and some women even get high and elevated estrogens. I mean, when a woman says to me, after I asked him the question, how do you feel? And she says, I feel great. I go, Yeah, well, maybe she is great. And maybe she's on too robust a dose for the long term. And for her safety. I did pick up on these issues when these occurred in this one because I have been testing them and I made the proper adjustments. I'd even like to go so far as to replace the term titration because titration was so accurate in the chemistry lab. I like to think a new way of describing this as incremental dosing, or dose determination. Mostly, you'll hear me say this throughout the course of this series. I've also taught the importance of understanding your dosages, for example, for you to know the difference between five tenths of a milligramme of Xanax and five milligrammes of Xanax, I use this illustration, because for a long time in my early career, I didn't know the difference. I had never prescribed Xanax, and I didn't realise that five milligrammes is basically a knockout dose in five tenths of a milligramme said enough substance to it. Well, I want to translate that into hormonal medicine, so that you get to know when someone tells you how many milligrammes they're taking, if something that you get a sense of, Well, we're in the spectrum of potency. Does this actually fall off? Is this not potent at all? Is it too potent a dose? Yeah, no your dosages. So once you know your dosages to pick an optimal starting dose, because that's the priority of them. Most of your first visits with a menopause patient is what am I going to prescribe for her starting with walking out the door. Once you know your basic dosages, then you pick a starting optimal dose, for example, with bias that's four tenths of a milligramme vestre Dial equivalent and you titrate no higher than a certain dose range maximum, which you specify to your patient don't go higher than what I'm suggesting here. That range maximum was biassed is no higher than 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, and I will explain what milligrammes of estradiol equivalent. It's a way to specify the potency, the milligrammes strength of bias as compared to Astra dial. Now, I also want to look at the test results of 28 out of 51 women who dosed within that optimal range, they arrived, as specified, somewhere between 0.8 and 2.6 milligrammes estradiol equivalent, why there's a range, there is some felt fine and felt good at 0.8 milligrammes of estradiol, Quilon, some felt fine 2.6, or somewhere in between, we're looking first at the 28 of the 51 woman who dose within that optimal range, well, 25% of those tested within the optimal range, they dosed within the optimal range, they tested within the optimal range. That's what we expect or hope for, but there was only 25% of them 18% of dose within the optimal range, but they tested above the optimum range greater than 14 micrograms per 24 hours, and 57% tested below the optimum range less than eight micrograms per 24 hours. Yikes. These were women who had followed my instructions, and had actually dose determined between eight tenths and 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, and this is what we found. That adds up to 75% 18 plus 57, actually tested outside the range, even though they had followed my instructions, and stayed within the dosage parameters. Let's look at 20 of the women who had dosed above the optimal range. That means they were satisfied when they had dose determined above 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent 35% of those women actually tested above the reference range, and that's what we would expect they dosed above their suggested dose parameters, and they tested above the expected optimal range 35% Actually dosed above but tested within the optimal range and 30% dose above and test below the actual range of less than eight micrograms per 24 hours. And then there were three women over 51, who dose below the optimum range less than eight milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, and two of them tested below that optimum range. Well, that's what we would expect goes below, tested below and one of them tested above the optimal range who had dose below what is going on here, none of them had tested within the optimal range. What the heck is going on here? Well, here's the fundamental principle of menopause medicine. When you're dealing with topical bioidentical hormones it's the amount of hormone applied to the skin or mucous membrane does not equal the amount of hormone that's actually absorbed. There's absorption issues, absorption through the skin varies greatly Woman to Woman and it varies as a woman ages. The dose applied once again, does not equal the dose determine necessarily what is all this call for. Once again, testing is imperative in menopause medicine. The takeaway proper hormone testing is an absolute imperative in menopause medicine.
