Now in prescribing biassed we need to understand the estriol to estradiol ratio, we need to be able to understand potency because look at that estradiol is eight times more potent, is estradiol. So this is the mathematical entry way into understanding something that's very important. You want to know how strong is the oestrogen that you are prescribing to a woman. And as far as what's actually possible to prescribe with biassed infinite number of combinations, one of the most common ones is an 8020 ratio, e three 80% e to 20%. Look at that prevalence of estradiol in the actual formulation. But actually, you could prescribe 7327. That's a common one for reasons I'm not going to go into right now. 7030 6040, it could be 6535, you could make it up. And be careful because you can drive your compounder up the wall. If you get eyeballing, there's no need for bar, I'm giving you all the choices that you'll ever need. You can even go less than 50% of estriol and greater than 30%, as to dial example 3070. The choice ultimately, of that ratio is going to be based entirely upon Well, I've got testing in bold and testing, underlined and testing rectangle bear, because it's going to be based on testing. And I strongly suggest to you that you do not mess with that ratio, unless you have 24 hour urine hormone tests. Why do I suggest that? Because many practitioners have and what surprises them is they start quickly getting into oestrogen excess that they didn't even detect until they repeated the 24 hour urine hormone test. I'll show you the math and how that can happen. So caution when you decrease estriol, and thus you increase estradiol, because you're gonna increase the potency quite a bit. There are cases where if you get too much estriol, and I'm showing that by increasing the amount of estriol is represented by that upward arrow, well, what happens is you increase the amount of estriol in the mathematics of it all in the oestrogen quotient, okay, fine. And it can get the EQ can get too high I II, there's too much oestrogen. Oh, what determines that if you have too much estriol by the law of chemical mass action, you're going to retard the conversion of metabolites 16 Alpha Hydroxy is thrown into estriol, you're gonna back this equation up, you're eventually going to get too much s drone. And thus, the two to 16 ratio by increasing the 16 alpha in the denominator is going to decrease. And six to 16 ratio is related to breast cancer risk. So we pay attention to this. So I'm just want to tell you what are going to be some of our parameters, some of our goalposts around how much estriol are we going to bring to the table here. Well, here's my preferred oestrogen quotients, somewhere between two and four, highly reliable. Now, I will accept an oestrogen quotient greater than four. That means there's four times or greater than four times as much estriol is there is the sum of a stone and estradiol. It's quite acceptable if a symptom alleviation is good. Because very often that will happen the woman say I feel fine, my symptoms are alleviated. And the two to 16 ratio is still greater than two. Now, Esther always used for a time in Japan, and Europe as the principal treatment, or one of the common treatments in the bio identical world of women in menopause. So with estriol influencing the oestrogen receptor site, beta does de proliferation. How much is too much, I mean, this is exactly what we want. But it turns out in actual clinical practice, that if a woman's ratio gets a little too high, too much str, sometimes she won't feel quite as right as you're used to hearing. And another thing that will turn out is when you see the 24 hour urine hormone test, often enough, you're gonna see a two to 16 ratio that's too low. Thus, there's a small amount but a, you know, an under scientifically shown amount, increased risk for breast cancer. So I'll accept greater than four. But if and only if the two to 16 ratio is still greater than two, and the woman feels good. And here's some articles backing all this up the relationship of serum estrogens and oestrogen metabolites to postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Oh, that's interesting. The conclusion being women with more extensive hydroxy halation along the two pathway that means favouring the two, as opposed to favouring the 16 Alpha pathway may have a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Notice this isn't absolute language, but there is enough evidence and this has gone through the scrutiny of being debated. And I still come up along in understanding the what has been presented in these debates. That to hydroxylation is favourable. So we want to have a proper amount of two which is twice as much as 16. Now, how do we actually understand the potency of biassed in there was a time in my career when I didn't understand the potency of Xanax I had never prescribed it and had a patient come to me and say I'd like you to help me get off of Xanax, and how much Was she taking seven milligrammes a day? And I was embarrassed to say that I didn't know how potent seven milligrammes is, in any of you have ever prescribed edX, you even any of you have taken Xanax know that that could put someone to sleep for a long period of time, that you know, half milligramme Xanax can be plenty even a quarter milligramme and the sensitives in one milligramme You know, that would be much, far more common. So, there is an analogy in every single medicine that we ever prescribe. What is the potency of the how much how potent is 10 grammes of Cipro well, and if you prescribe Cipro No, man, that's way too high, you know, 500 milligrammes a couple times a day is usually will to get the job done. We want to understand potency. So for example, biassed STR plus estradiol has variation in the milligrammes per millilitre, and the absolute almost 100% milligrammes per litre that we start a woman off with is the organic oils is 30 milligrammes per millilitre, and then on the second prescription, the second prescription is needed at the end of the month, we're going to be changing that milligrammes per millilitre, so, 25 milligrammes per millilitre is common 41, or there can be any milligrammes per millilitre, in that ballpark when you're dealing with the organic oils, and likewise with the gels are very common starting milligrammes per millilitre is an 8020 formulation of 2.5 milligrammes per millilitre, or you could prescribe half of that strength 1.25 milligrammes per millilitre, or 2.75 milligrammes per millilitre, these are all common. This is one way to talk about strength milligrammes per millilitre, obviously. But the other thing that relates to the strength of bIast is the ratio of str to estradiol. And, again, I'm listing a whole series of ratios possible and any ratio is possible. The most common one and the one we start every single woman off in our practice, is by us, 30 milligrammes familiar at 20. But these other ratios are possible. And as I mentioned before, I wouldn't dream of changing that ratio, unless and only if I looked at 24 year and hormone test results that had the qualifiers in it that I was talking about early, such as too much 16 alpha in too high of a tutus too low of a two to 16 ratio, be one of them. Well, there's a difference of potency in estradiol and estriol. In fact, estradiol is eight times as strong as estriol A times as potent as it so how do we figure that out? And really what that translates into is one milligramme of biassed is not equivalent to one milligramme of estradiol
