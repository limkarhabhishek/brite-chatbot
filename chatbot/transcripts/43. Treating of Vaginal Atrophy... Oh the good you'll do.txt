When vaginal atrophy is moderately severe severe, you can use the bias that you're using for transdermal or topical application in the vagina, and this is the same prescription that women start off with so much of the time 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20. It's point four four milligrammes of estradiol equivalents per drop, and you can just be applied with a finger to the vagina in the organic base, they're 100% Organic these oils. Another way to do this is through a tube of estriol 80 grammes. One milligramme per gramme Estro really helps the vagina it's one of the main differences in pregnancy. The estriol concentrations are so high, then one of the things that that estriol achieves is just vaginal elasticity and great vaginal mucosal health. Gotta put it in a non astringent carrier, that's for sure. An 80 gramme tube and here's how you apply it you fill up a little tampon like applicator and you have the woman applied HS while she's recumbent it will drift down to the rest of the vagina. You can also add testosterone one milligramme per millilitre because testosterone is very healthy for the vagina as well is women grow older and they're still having intercourse and their vaginas are not as moist, not as lubricated. As they were this is optimal. My favourite is this organic coconut oil. It's It's great stuff. It's a great lubricant and it's healthy. And there are other organic vaginal lubricants on the market. They certainly don't have parabens or petrochemicals in it. But unfortunately some women are sensitive to whatever is in there. After all, there is a solvent in there and so I am no longer recommending these are using these
