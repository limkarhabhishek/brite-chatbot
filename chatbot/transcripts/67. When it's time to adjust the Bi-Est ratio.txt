So you've adjusted the bias ratio. And now I want to take you into the mega blaster for the so inclined. And I salute you for making it this far that this work is not for the faint of heart. That work is a piece of cake. And it's simple. If you're not, if you just want to do what physicians have done with women and menopause, for the whole 3040 50 years when Premarin was available, and in the initial phases of bioidenticals, you just give them a prescription and they go out and they feel better, and it's no big deal. And you never test them in the North American menopause. Society to this day recommends that you don't test because it knows the problems with serum testing. And it's sure feeling strong feelings about saliva, and it doesn't know about 24 hour urine hormone testing yet. We hope to bridge that with the North American menopause society. That's one of my dreams is that we get to bridge this into mainstream because I think the the right way to treat with menopause is now well understood, perfect. No. But oh my goodness. How elegant is it? So this is not for the faint of heart. This photograph of this particular photographer leafing back onto that rock is just staggering to me, oh God, and he did it Bless his heart. So let's say that the patient arrives at this third visit and I'm going to give you an example here. She's feeling better than she hasn't a long time and she's very appreciative of that. But she's still having an occasional hot flashes night even having a racing mind because you remember accoutrement of a hot flashes and and gentleman's adrenaline surge, when you're 20 years old, and you get an adrenaline surge, you metabolise that off so quick, it's long gone in a very short period of time, but when you're 50 years old, and your liver has got 50,000 miles on it, it's a little slower to, for example, dismantle caffeine and excrete caffeine. And that's also true for the estrogens and the steroid hormones, in fact, just about anything, that the liver has to metabolise so that woman can be up with a racing mind for as long as it takes to metabolise off that adrenaline. So this is still women are still shocked by this because they're wide awake, because they've got adrenaline on board, and you know, who wants to be wide awake in the middle of the night. So, now, I want to present to you the kind of visit that the third visit could be when you do have test results. And just for an example of the patient that is arriving to this third visit, she's feeling better than in a long time, but she's still having an occasional nocturnal hot flash, along with racing mind, and that'll keep her up for half hour hour, hour and a half, two hours, as long as it takes for her 55 year old liver to burn to metabolise off the adrenaline that was the accoutrement of the hot flash and she's still complaining of the amount of energy she'd like to have. And so I want to zero in on what we're treating her with and what test results she's got. So she's 55 years old, and she was on remember that the last dose calculator, we put her back down to 33 milligrammes per millilitre, of course, she was on at 20. That's from a second consultation, that adds up to 2.4 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. And you see the range, the optimal range there is 0.8 to 2.6 with the average of 1.7. And then let's look at the test result. Her E two was 4.3 micrograms for 24 hours for each one was 8.1 months pretty typical is about twice as much you want as there is E two, and that gives her a total potent estrogens at 12.4. Wow, that's pretty ballpark in my favourite zone, and her e three was 64. And her oestrogen quotient was 5.2. That's a little above that's showing a prevalence of estriol. I mean, think about it. 64 micrograms for 24 hours of estradiol compared to four and eight of E to any one. Yeah, that's what gives her the high oestrogen quotient when you do the math. Now, ordinarily, if she was feeling well, I would not make a change. And a lot of women will, because why not have the more oestrogen the merrier? I mean, I have gone through in detail about the oestrogen receptor side beta. I'm very content, but you know that you can back up the two to 16 ratio. And if you get a little bit too much yesterday, all so is the key to the highway for her that she doesn't have enough extra dial. And that happens occasionally. Could it be that she needs a little bit more extra dial and so then want to change the ratio? Well, that would be the experiment I'd want to do. I say experiment because you know, you can come up with an idea but the proofs in the pudding so you design something for a woman, but you know, does it work? So this is the bias ratio. calculator and this is not for the faint of heart, the calculators easy to use. But you're going to go into the high altitudes as you start contemplating exactly what's going on here. So these are the entry fields, the choices you have, if they're grey, you can enter something in them. And if they're white, they're going to auto calculate, and oh, there's a couple more entry fields to adjust for the new prescription. So here we go. This is the previous prescription just to bring forward that information. So we have some reference point and show you what I did here. So we enter her name and this is coming straight off the previous prescription, we choose biassed, we have to choose the milligrammes per millilitre in this particular one, and we've got to choose the previous ratio because this happens to be a calculator that you can use into the future to if you have altered the ratio, and then from that point on, it's going to auto calculate the milligrammes invested Dow equivalent per drop in the five drops is auto entered, because remember, that's one of the stable values we want to deal with, and then it all auto calculates the total milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day, and then it auto enters into the new RX the bias because you're gonna stay with bias, but you have to select the new milligrammes per millilitre, so I want to recall what's going on with her. She's feeling better than a long time, but she still has occasional hot flashes at night with racing mind, and still has complaining of insufficient energy. So, my theory would be she doesn't have enough milligrammes per millilitre, but we've already tweaked that, it might be in that ratio, she needs a little more extra Dharwar find out but just to play a little more dose was a tried initially, and we didn't succeed with that, so let's try to increase the E too. So just to start off, I'm going to enter manually the 33 milligrammes per millilitre, she's already on, then I'm gonna play with the ratio, and I'm going to adjust the ratio from 8020 to 7030. And what does that do? That increases the amount of estradiol it reduces the percentage of estriol from 80% to 70% of that formulation, and then increases the amount of extra dial from 20% up to 30%. There's the change, let's see what happens. It's going to auto calculate the milligrammes vestre Dial equivalent per day Oh 0.63. And it's going to tell us the total by multiply 0.6 times five, because it's five drops per day. And that also shows us that that was a 30% increase in the in the dosage from last time from the 2.4 Hmm, that's a little bit rich there, said a little bit higher than I want to go probably a 30 percentage increase that seems a little bit excessive there from 2.4 to 3.1. Well, I can adjust that let's reduce the dosage jump by decreasing the milligrammes per millilitre. So instead of 33, I'll put in 30, I'll keep that ratio is 7030, because I want a higher percentage of estradiol. Look at that, it's still gives us a higher than the standard 8020. Remember the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per drop for an 8020 was point four, four now for a 7030, it turns out to be 0.57, the rest is auto calculated, this time, it's a 22% jump, that seems more reasonable to go from 2.4 to 2.8. This is what I want to try. And the big change is she's getting a little more extra dial. Now, will that work? Maybe. And a lot of times it will, this, these, these are the fine tuning adjustments, and that's the third visit, and you give her instructions. You say, Hey, listen, if you feel better, you're good for a year. I'll write your prescriptions for a year. If you don't feel better, call me we'll have another consultation. Most often when you're tweaking at the level, that third calculator tweaked, you're not going to have to repeat the 24 hour urine hormone test, you've learned so much. And if you're keeping the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent, within reason, not a 50% increase, you can go back to your test results, and you'll see well I couldn't have increased it that much. So you won't have to retest nine times out of 10. When you're doing these final tweaking, even looking at that 24 hour urine, you're doing a tweak there, you're not going to have to retest. So there's more to it and again, as a member of the menopause method, because you are if you want to be you can always run any amount of challenging cases by me for no charge. You just email me we set up a time that I'm available for that because this is the arena we're in now. And how did I learn? Well,

I did I did a lot of Figuring out between my patients and the 24 hour urines. And but now you have me and our staff to consult with you and help you sort through some of the most challenging cases. So, there's more to these calculators. And we have specific videos really short ones that number one, show you where to go, what to click on, to get to the first calculator, which is the second consultation calculator, the second adjusting calculator, and this third ratio adjusting calculator. We have specific short videos, how to access them, how to use them. So you got the shorter version right here. And we want to walk you through step by step how to access them, how to use them in our onboarding videos, and they're on the website under the members area. Once you are a member until you resign, or maybe you won't. I don't know that we've ever had a resignation after a decade or so of doing this work with physicians.
