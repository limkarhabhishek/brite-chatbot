So I want to give you an example of a second consultation. Remember, this is the first follow up. They've done the initial consultation. And now we're doing the follow up consultation. Remember what I said something about details later on. I'm going to talk about some of those details. Well, the very first thing we do is that follow up questionnaire review. And let's say that the patient has much improved and that she's on what originally prescribed by us, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 23 drops bi D, and progesterone, 200 milligrammes per millilitre, six drops, HS, and she's still awakening in the middle of the night for about an hour and a half with hot flashes and erasing mine. So, immediately, something should come to your mind that she's probably still a little oestrogen deficient. So should we just increase the biassed? Well, there's a logistic problem, should we increase it to three and four? Well, that's a little bit too much oil to apply twice daily to the forearms, and it's seven drops a day, for 28 days a month, let's say 28 days a month, because she's gonna stop for 1234 days. That's a total of 196 drugs. Well, these bottles are very accurately calibrated to dispense just over a month, and an eight and a half millilitre bottle times 20 drops, a bias per millilitre is 176 drops. That's not enough drops. If she goes up to three and four plus, you wouldn't want to go up to three and four, and so there's not enough oil in that prescription. And the same thing can be if you're also going into pumps or however you're dispensing gels and creams. Now this is an important point. That the optimal amount we've determined over the course of all these years for a woman to apply as far as drops to her forearm are biassed is two drops in the morning and three drops in the evening. Why three drops in the evening, because averting any nocturnal oestrogen deficiency symptoms. That's a high premium. Because women can easily tolerate warm rushes and hot flashes during the day. But if it wakes them up in the middle of the night, and it takes a while for them to metabolise off the adrenaline which is the accoutrement of the hot flash, then that's a big issue. So we tend to always favour that nocturnal dose, we balance it. So two and three is a good balance. One and four is not but two and three years. And when a woman has to increase the dose by one drop, or decrease the dose by one drop, which they do from time to time. I mean, every day is not the exact same hormonal need day, as every other day. For example, if a woman goes through a period of exceptional stress, and what's going to happen is that oestrogen is going to be recruited to partially to do the stress response. And so she's going to need a little more during that stress. But the question is, if you're going to increase by one drop, you don't want to increase too much or too little. And what increasing two and three by one drop or decreasing it as a 20%, increase or decrease for each change. Contrast that with a woman who is doing one in one, one drop in the morning and one drop in the evening? Well, a dose increase or decrease of one drop is a 50% change each time. And I found it even more challenging to doing the math with gels, spoons, pumps, clicks, et cetera. So drops make it a lot easier to do these alterations. But still, if they're at one in one, well, why in the heck would they be at one in one because many physicians have been an advocate primarily for the patient's pocketbook. And of course, there's merit to that, my goodness. And so the method became an even taught it for a while until I saw the several problems that arose with that. But if a patient told me that she was on to into and that's what she felt really good on, and she tested. Great on that there was a time when I would say Well listen, what I'm going to do is I'm going to double the strength. And then you'll use half as much so instead of doing two until you use half as much, you'll do one and one that is that half the price for that patient. But, you know, it certainly doesn't work for the pharmacists, and who are very important allies, and it doesn't work with his dosage increase of 50% change each time you want to go up and down. That does not work at all. So all things considered the optimal amount of biassed just two drops in the morning and three drops in the evening. And in order to achieve that, with a fixed amount of millilitres, 8.5 All we have to do is recalculate the milligrammes per millilitre. And I'll walk you through a few of those calculations. And that'll give You have a chance to see how that works. So five drops a day will work quite well with eight and a half millilitres and thus that are x last one month, probably a little more. And I'd like to pause and put in a word for LH si P. Almost everyone makes out on those doublings patients get very inexpensive treatments far more inexpensive than they can get anywhere in the medical world. And physicians and nurse practitioners become semi heroes. And all that's well and good except it's almost everyone in the one who doesn't do good is Lord help are compounding pharmacists. And I find that the big focus in medicine has been on the professional relationships. And that would include the doctor and the nurse practitioner and the patient. But there's a new kid on the block. There's nothing new about combining pharmacists. But when you're dealing with bioidentical hormones that need to be compounded. It's different than dealing with a regular commercial pharmacy when they are very tied to the pharmaceutical industry. And bless their hearts to everyone is working pretty hard. All the time. I do recognise that but you want a good relationship with your local compounding pharmacist. And I'm taking a little aside here, because a lot of things have transformed in the world of compounding pharmacists. For one thing, I would not be sitting here doing this work without compounding pharmacists. They'd been terrific allies. And we are so lucky to have the neighbourhood compounding pharmacist survived the hurricane that's come down upon them because of the New England compounding pharmacy disaster. And if you don't know what that was, there was a law violator. They were not a compounding pharmacy. They were a dud. They were manufacturing is what they were doing. And of all one deal that they did. They made probably a lot of you know this. They were manufacturing injectables, including injectable steroids that went near the spinal column. And there was mould in their facilities. And they This was known about for years before the ultimate tragedy occurred. And they were be they were sent letters announcing that they had to clean up their act majorly. And this was quite a moment of truth for how this world really works. Because what happened was, they didn't close them down when they saw that mould. They didn't come in and make demands that they were not allowed to produce one more injectable and injectables a whole different universe than trans dermal, oh my God. It's not hard to imagine that and they weren't closed down. They were allowed to keep functioning until the deaths occurred and over 100 people died from these fungus infected injectable steroids. And many, many more people got severely debilitated from Mrs. egregious tragedy and of course, the word compounding pharmacy was in their name. And the repercussions of that for all of our beloved compounding pharmacists have been humongous. New federal regulations come in in June of 2018. And there are major expenses that are going to be called for these pharmacists are going to have to prepare bioidentical topical hormones in conditions that are really set up for injectable and they're incurring enormous expenses to do so. The first one of the pharmacists that I've worked with for 23 years, is having to add $150,000 addition on to his building to follow all the regulations that are coming down to him and then there's going to be a question and this has not been totally decided, but is there going to be a beyond use date of one month for these hormones. So some of these things are to be decided, but all the rest of it has been decided. But if so, or not the optimal drops per day can be calculated, and be related to the milligrammes per millilitre and the E two e three ratio. So we've gone ahead and complied with this fruit. The main reason of everything I've been explaining thus far is a one month prescription is reasonable, and it allows the pharmacist to also maintain a roof over their head plus employees plus all the equipment they have. And I know the ins inside scoop of several of these pharmacists. And my God, we really want to help these folks out, at least, to do fair and decent business. Well, it turns out that if there is a beyond use data that comes in as a federal regulation that hasn't been fully decided it's going to work really well. With the menopause method. We've already designed it to accommodate that. We didn't totally design it just to accommodate that. We designed it for all the reasons that I've explained right now to come up with a one month prescription
