Now I'd like to talk about androgens. And in the very in hormone Genesis roadmap, remember that cholesterol gets converted to the Great Grandma hormone, which is actually hormonally active pregnenolone, which can transform to DHEA, among other things, and DHEA is conjugated with a sulphate to be able to transport it through the blood. And that's the major way it's carried then DHEA can convert and Christina Dion which convert to testosterone, those are interconvertible. And then the principal and metabolites of Angelina downer eto clan alone and Andrew throne, there is a more obscure pathway, where progesterone can also convert and Christina down. And we learned this first through the use of the birth control pill, because of the progestins. I mean, there's a certain number of women that got some moustache hairs from using birth control pills, and turned out the progestin is very much androgenic is well, far more than progesterone itself is, but that's another issue. And even progesterone itself does have a not common pathway in which it can be converted to understand a diode, thus the antigens and then of course, the androgens, testosterone, they understand the down convert to estradiol and estrone respectively. There is that group of androgens and what we're assessing on the 24 hour urine hormone test is the DHEA. The testosterone Ito clan alone and the Andhra throne. DHEA and testosterone are the parent hormones eto collana loans principally a metabolite of DHEA. But testosterone can also metabolise through there and then Andrus rune is from for metabolites for both of them, you know, those parent hormones and those metabolites and you know, 99% of what is important to know about the androgens how they show up on a test, and we're going to focus in on that test and focus in on androgens and let's talk about them. DHEA s, the hydro epi and Astra rune sulphate. Well, it's the major product of the adrenal of the zona reticularis. I always found that fascinating and loved to look under the microscope and see the various zones of the adrenal gland, and the adrenal gland is putting out between three and a half to 20 milligrammes a day of DHEA s, that is the most abundant steroid in our body and the serum concentrations are within that range. And then there's DHEA unconjugated are free, and that's produced in the adrenal gland, the zona reticularis about 50% of it is produced there and in the ovarian theaker, about 20% of what is produced there, and about 30% is derived from circulating DHEA s, and six to eight milligrammes of free DHEA is produced every day. So, these are very large amounts of DHEA being produced in a day. It was serum concentrations, and of course, and a lot less compare that with a third of a milligramme per day of oestrogen and 37 milligrammes a day mid luteal for progesterone, you sort of get an idea of how these hormones are proportional to one another. It does not speak about potency. Each individual hormone it just speaking about amounts and DHEA is also produced in the brain. Hmm, maybe there's a reason for that there is so DHEA is the most abundant of the circulating steroid hormones. It's the precursor to the production of testosterone estrogens and metabolites as well. DHEA has a neuroactive effect and is one possible remedy for anxiety and depression. And the principal metabolite is probably eto. collana alone remarkably, DHEA X is a full agonist of er beta with a response similar to that of estradiol, but it's a much weaker agonist than estriol. Here's an article on DHEA metabolism and the conclusions of it are the small sample size notwithstanding, these data emphasise the potential behaviour relevance of Andrus terone In humans, which may include contribution to the antidepressant effect of DHEA. There's a metabolite being active potential bait behavioural relevance of Andrus terone, one of the metabolites of DHEA regarding the understanding of dial in and testosterone, it's produced in the adrenal zone of physical out at 50% and the ovarian stroma as well, the understanding down is and it varies throughout the cycle somewhat, and you get between 1.4 and 6.2 milligrammes a day varying with the menstrual cycle, and there's a certain concentration let's talk about the principal and most potent of the androgens, testosterone and for women, again, it's the most potent is produced in the adrenal and the Zona physical out about 25% of it. The Ovarian stroma about 25% Oh, look at that. That means if a variant As testosterone declines, you can still get some out of the adrenal gland a significant amount. And you can also get some from circulating Andrus Tina down. And since Andrew Steena down is produced in the adrenal, zona fasciculata, as well 50% of it is there is a postmenopausal source of Andhra of testosterone, testosterone, only a 10th to four tenths of milligramme a day are produced, but my goodness that has a lot of effects. So again, the actual amount doesn't matter so much is how potent is that effect and how detrimental is not having that effect in the world of testosterone, my goodness, just think sarcopenia for example, and the impact of that on any human being male or female, and you can compare him the amount of milligrammes per day produces e two, which is three tenths of a milligramme. So you can produce a little more testosterone even then you can have Astra dial, and also DHEA is seven milligrammes per day. So it just puts a mouse in perspective. Now, just for fun, and this isn't going to be that clinically useful. Just to compare how these hormones are produced, the DHEA s is coming primarily out of the adrenal secretion with some peripheral conversion, the DHEA that's the amount of coming from the adrenal and that's the amount coming from the ovary, and that's the amount coming from peripheral conversion. And the understanding the diode is illustrated thusly, and the testosterone comes from three places as well. You know, I just enjoy this stuff a lot. Because you hear so much about these and then you start figuring all this Yeah, right. I remember seeing those adrenal glands in histology and this is how it's going. The testosterone because it's a steroid hormone, and that means they are fat soluble and they are not water soluble, the vast majority of it is carried bound in the serum. And 69% of that is bound by sex hormone binding globulin alert. You've heard me give a little eyebrow up to Section One binding globulin and here we're going into one of the reasons why we do that 30% of it is bound to albumin, there's a heck of a lot more albumin, but the binding coefficient is nowhere near as tight and the sex hormone binding globulin declines in menopause, which means you can get some increased free testosterone in early menopause. And you know, often you'll see increased hair growth in places where it's not, not great for a woman to have it and moustache area, chin area. And so sometimes this is one of the causes of that. Now birth control pills and oral estrogens increased the SH BG and transdermal estrogens do not increase sh PG. Well, an exception to that. If you give excessive dosages of any steroid hormone, well especially oestrogen and testosterone, you are going to increase that sh BG. But it was so common for the oral estrogens, which is Dr. Wright has pointed out, we're probably given eight times the dose that they need to be as revealed by 24 hour urine hormone testing levels of oestrogen. And as far as the testosterone levels go, they may not change in the beginning of menopause. But testosterone can be produced out of the ovary for a little longer duration than the oestrogen and the progesterone can and there's always the adrenal testosterone and how can the body compensate for the loss of oestrogen it can aromatize testosterone so I don't know the exact mechanics of it. But I do know that in some cases the testosterone levels may elevate in the beginning of perimenopause and early menopause, but I've tested hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of women and I can tell you, these androgen increases do not sustain and androgens like estrogens and like progesterone, and like DHEA within 1234 years those androgens are going to start declining majorly. So, some women go into the perimenopause with decline androgens either DHEA testosterone or both. So some of them have been declining since the beginning. And again, they may increase in the beginning of menopause, but they're going to decline as one and five years after the onset of menopause, you can bank on that. And that is highly significant because one of the veins of the elderly, which I mentioned in other places in this teaching programme, is without sufficient androgens, they can get sarcopenia and the consequences to the lower extremities and their ability to maintain their balance from walking and standing. And, you know, thus fall on to the ground and sometimes fracture their hips and other bones for sure pelvis humerus. I've seen I've seen other types of fractures in the elderly.

Boy, you will want to keep our eye on these antigens and it's just one other reason to do that annual 24 hour urine hormone tests because you Do not want to miss the decline of androgens. When you interview women who are older, and they've suffered androgen decline and sarcopenia they don't like it and they when it hits the elevator and I and they can't support their bladder and their uterus and they're getting coffee and kindness and they're wearing adult diapers. You know, they can endure it and they do. But my goodness gracious. Better to keep the androgens. The androgens turn out to be one of the greatest services we can do to support women for the course of their whole life. Now, I would never leave oestrogen, progesterone or DHEA, as far as the steroid hormones or thyroid hormone are and a lot of other factors. But these hormones are so potent. So I want to even though I've left androgens for later in this discussion, I want to elevate them to the importance that they are remember that gerontologist that I spoke about the Torah senior medical students that yeah, you guys know a lot of diagnoses, and hundreds and 1000s of them. But let me tell you what's really happening to the elderly, they get sarcopenia and they fall on their acid periodic bones. So do something about that. Now, there wasn't remedies known in that in those days other than exercise, and that's your makes a difference, including to the levy terrain ie via the quote, Kegel exercises, squeeze your anus. Let's all do it together. Now
