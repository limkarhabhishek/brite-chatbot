We've been talking about formulations. And we're moving on to the base that is used, compounded topical hormones are prepared in a base. So when we're writing a prescription, what we want is the best hormone quality, of course, and compounding pharmacists have access to the best of the best. And we want the best carrier quality. So let's play what's in a jar is I did one day when I opened up a jar long time ago. And there's the hormones are in that jar. And that would be in the case of biassed it would be pure estriol and pure estradiol. And the carrier is in that jar, otherwise known as the base or the vehicle. And I want to ask the question, what is the chemical nature of the carrier because that's what happened. When accidentally a prescription was shipped to my office. I opened up the jar, just because they had never seen compounded hormones in a gel. And it looked very pretty. And there was this strong smell. And I went, Oh, that must be the solvents. Yes, because what else would that be? And so I started asking questions about the nature of that carrier. And one of the questions I asked Is there any additional chemicals in the carrier such as solvents and absorption facilitators? Let's talk about the solubility of estrogens and all steroid hormones. Well, they're freely soluble in alcohol. They're also soluble in acetone, dioxane, and other organic solvents. Ooh, getting intense there, and they're sparingly soluble in vegetable oils. They're extremely poorly soluble in water. The most you can get is in 3.6 milligrammes per litre, which is point 0036 milligrammes per millilitre, and water for 1000s of a milligramme per millilitre. So, can't put them up in water, and let's take a look at a jar of bias, 2.5 milligrammes per gramme, and an 80 gramme jar of carbopol here's the math, two and a half milligrammes per gramme of hormone and 80 grammes equals two and a half milligrammes per gramme times 80 grammes. That means there's a grand total of 200 milligrammes in that jar of actual hormone, or two tenths of a gramme of hormone in an 80 gramme base. There's 80 gramme of base divided by two tenths of a gramme of hormone. There's 400 times as much carrier as much base, is there an hormones in that jar? So what's actually in the jar? Three tenths of 4% is actual hormone and 99.7% is carrier. Okay. And what are these carriers made out of? Well, they're chemicals in solvents for very good reasons. Because estradiol is so poorly soluble, even in fat, it must be dissolved in solvents that dissolve fat. If you want a uniform distribution of the hormone throughout the jar, which you do want so that every single dose administered will contain the same amount of biassed estradiol, whatever we're making it out of. Even if you put the hormones in an oil, it will not dissolve without solvents. Here's a depiction of that, where most of that is carrier and at the bottom, the actual hormones have settled out because they're not in solution. So the whole purpose of carriers that have solvents in them, is to dissolve the hormones for uniform distribution throughout the whole carrier. That's what carbopol looks like. It's one of the most common carriers that have ever been on this planet. There definitely are others. And most compounding pharmacists have the option of lots of different carriers. And it's called a hydro alcoholic gel. And here's what it's made out of. Acrylic acid poly crosslinked with poly alkyl ethers die vinyl glycol. Hmm, that sounds like propylene glycol is something that's related to antifreeze, carboxy vinyl polymer duck those names and there's a resource if you want to look further into it. Well, I had a concern that the solvents might be toxic. And I've been a holistic physician all of my life all my professional life. In my goodness, as you have undoubtedly met up with one or many women who are in men who are extremely sensitive to everything. Were a little bit of something adverse really can affect them. I got I was concerned that the solvents might be a problem. And I looked up the other solvents as well lipid DERM. Well, that's a more intense solvent, because you can for example, To get twice as much progesterone up into lipid Durham as you can get it into carbopol and PLO very commonly used one consisting of lipids and a polymer. And there it is veronik polyethylene, polypropylene glycol, as one pharmacist once described this stuff to me call it nasty stuff. PLO and there's Vanicream and take a look at the chemicals. There they are again and propylene glycol is in there when I was a young man in my late teens and early 20s. I was fascinated with automobiles and I worked on my own cars all the time, and I never mind getting greasy or dirty. But I did mind emptying the antifreeze because if it got to my hand, it turned my skin white. So I thought man that antifreeze is fierce and that's what propylene glycol is. So here's the North American menopause Society's website. They are the authority for our traditional physicians, working with menopause. And I've just highlighted what they have to say about bioidentical hormones. Well, they quote recommend in quote bioidenticals, but not the compounded ones. They're very explicit about that. They want the government approved bioidentical hormone therapy products. And it turns out that these are all in only estradiol products. There's no bias. There's no estradiol in these in their in chemical laden carriers. And here's one of their articles about bioidentical hormone therapy for the treatment of menopause. It's not supported, that have warned women about the potential harm from these bioidentical hormones. My goodness gracious, I wonder what their evidence is. They've never seen that where there are commercially available and several well tested, government approved brand name prescriptions, and here they are, here's their list. And there's the oral estrogens which are approved. No, no, no, an oral estrogens not the state of the art, not the safest things for all the reasons that I have mentioned. And we'll mention. And then there's the topical, and there's the patches. And I'll talk about patches. There's the gels. And there's the sprays. And I'll have more to say about these. And there's the vaginal preparations, pure estradiol, acetate and not pure Ester dial. And here's a comparison of the commercial oestrogen products. And what I'd like you to see about them is that the vehicle that the majors use, there are three of them use carbopol, one of them uses ethyl alcohol. The other two to the right of that is patches, and then there's soil and there's a lot of problems with soil, never recommend that. So look at that three of the principal ones, the most popular ones. Are the commercial products using extra dial alone. No, estriol are the vehicles carbopol, the other ones alcohol. And here's a little example of what's available there on the market. And there's the patches and take a look what else is in the patches. And they claim that all these components, the remaining components are pharmacologically inactive. Hmm.

I don't think so. Dye propylene glycol is not pharmacologically inactive, you'll see in just a minute. And here's one of the most popular ones of all it's in carbon 940. And that happens to be carbopol. And it's got ethanol in it and propylene glycol antifreeze, there we go and I ethylene bladder and we go more chemical names and they I don't know why they call that all pharmacologically inactive because that is not true. So here's a chest surgeon, Dr. Wilson talking about propylene glycol toxicity. Here's his conclusion. Propylene Glycol toxicity is a potentially life threatening I attr genic complication that is common and preventable. And he reviews actual case studies of his and he was a burns in one of the things he was working with his burn patients. And of course, they're using topical sulphur dyes in silver cream, they're putting on a heck of a lot more onto very vulnerable skin. Women aren't putting hundreds or 1000s of the amount of volume on their skin. But it does. It's like the canary in the coal mine if these people are getting sick and having big problems, and that's what Dr. Wilson is describing. With a softening and burn skin, of course, much more porous surface. We does it does catch my attention. So I'm not saying women are vulnerable to that amount. But let's do the math on how much we asked women to put on. At the time I was using carbopol. And each day they were using one millilitre bias plus or minus and then a millilitre progesterone, a millilitre testosterone. So three millilitres a day were being applied to their skin, which is over 1000 millilitres a year. And which is over a quarter year, which is over a gallon or in a four year period and I've got women that I've been shooting for for 812 16 years. So this adds up. It's not a small amount to apply. And of course, there's the risk benefit ratio, and there's what we can tolerate. But you know, I have been an organic guy all my adult life. And this one I've dealt with a lot of sensitive patients. And so this one caught my attention big time. Well, the pharmaceuticals there's estradiol only and there's no estriol. Their bases they contain have solvents in them, and the solvents have toxic potential, and compounding pharmacies also use solvent based carriers as well. What shall we do? Well, I propose that we design a carrier that is non toxic, with no solvents, well, that's going to be a suspension, because these things are not going to go up into solution. In any ordinary non provocative basis. I'm once again showing you that the hormones are going to come out of suspension and my goodness, we put so much care time and energy into developing organic oils blend, it's a proprietary mix. This is my topical, a team of high end skin oils. And it's a we use in their certified organic, and there are no solvents in there. And they are a suspension. And one of the ingredients one of the principal ingredients is molecularly. Similar to sebum, there's a comparison, you know, a rough pictorial comparison, and all of the prescriptions that we've used. We're backed by 24 hour urine hormone, test hundreds and hundreds of them because I'm 10 years into having worked with this, and it's also a unique delivery system that delivers a drop by drop. I'll show you that. So what are the right hormones well compounded bioidentical and minimise those solvents
