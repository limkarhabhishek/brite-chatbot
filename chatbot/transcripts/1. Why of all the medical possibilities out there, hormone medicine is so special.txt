Well, in 1993, into my office comes Deborah, a patient that I've known for 10 years at that time. And she's saying to me, and she was terribly upset, I feel horrible, and I'm going insane. And she really meant it. She was a little angry at me because she was a little concerned that I wasn't going to believe her in serendipitously or you know how our lives and practices go. I had happened to be speaking to Dr. John Lee, who taught me about progesterone. And I gave Deborah some progesterone. And three weeks later, I get a call from her saying, Thank you so much, I'm totally myself again. Well, that was a very impressive event for me. Because I've been a functional medicine doctor all my career. And most often when people by the time they come to the doctor's office, and they're not feeling well, there's a piece of work to do. And it's a step by step and sometimes even a slog, as many of you know, and here I had given a woman, some transdermal hormones, and she felt better majorly and quickly, well, however, our careers go, that happened to be a turning point in mine. And one of the reasons I'm telling you this story is this is very rewarding work. And one of the most common things that happens to human beings is this major decline in hormones, which are very potent, powerful biochemicals to lose them is a big deal. And then restoring them is not that tricky, and it's a piece of work to get it. Excellent. And that's what our programme is about excellence. reducing risk, for example, as close to zero as we can possibly get it. So, you're tuning in, and I'm thinking this may affect your lives in practice as well in all the patients that you will be seeing over the course of years. Off we go on this journey.
