I'd like to talk to you about neurotransmitters. Because these are not as potent I find as the hormones, but they're in this whole territory of well being. And when the when you're doing excessive fight or flight biochemistry, you're not just putting out additional amounts of hormones, you're putting out additional amounts of neurotransmitters and I think they go hand in glove with you. When you start over writing your system and pushing yourself too far. You're going to put out the the chemicals to be able to accomplish the task of rising to your high bar and you're going to be putting out hormones and neurotransmitters so they deplete and DHA they deplete. I mean, millions of people taking Prozac and other SSRIs and other psychoactive pharma surgical drugs are taking them for a reason. They mood alter, they help a lot of people, to me catching this at the neurotransmitter and depletion and imbalance level and doing nutritional supplements is a far more elegant and kind way to do this in long range than doing the uptake inhibitors ie enzyme blockers that the SSRIs are but I never say never My goodness. I know a lot of patients that they are very thankful with for SSRIs. And they've really helped them navigate through life, reduce their stress, reduce their excessive responses, do much better with their work in their home life and heal just from doing that. So, I am not trying to diminish the importance of psychoactive medications like SSRIs and the variations like Wellbutrin, that also affect the catecholamines, et cetera. And at the same time, I've had success assessing the neurotransmitters and I find the neurotransmitter testing to be quite good. And also replenishing the neurotransmitters with neuro with nutritional supplements. So some of the aspects about neurotransmitters the testing is easier, is a single morning urine collection, not the very first one. On awakening, you don't want that one that's picking up the neurotransmitter byproducts that occurred overnight. But once you get up and you're going it's the second morning urine is usually the best one. The treatment is less complex and involves nutritional supplements. It's not inexpensive, and your treatment with nutrients, vitamins, minerals and amino acids and precursors to the biochemistry of neurotransmitter production. The treatment may not be as dramatic as the SSRIs in the variants like Wellbutrin, etc. But it's a slow steady climb out. And that's that's valuable in itself. Or sometimes we help people who are in acute duress with the SSRIs. I have someone who has skills in that area to prescribe those, I'm not skilled with those. And then once they're stabilised, and they're leading a good life, and that can be six months, a year, two years, whatever it takes, and they want to titrate off and see if we can help them with the supplements. That's also another approach to this or you can do the supplements right out of the gate. So let me give you an example. This is a 40 year old woman who's well functioning but she's tired. And look at that serotonin level not too bad. Look at that optimal range 150 to 200. And she's up at 113. And that's pretty good for serotonin. But where we're seeing the lowness is in the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. Oh, a little tired. Yeah, we so commonly think of adrenaline and noradrenaline is Yeah, they're really important for the stress response, but these are day to day. They're really designed for living. And yes, they will double in function to mobilise for fight or flight. And this woman is obviously been mobilising for fight or flight because she's got some neurotransmitter depletion and a dopamine is pretty decent. And just to see if we see any evidence of stress anywhere else, I've taken a look at the corticosteroids and I do see that there is slight depletion of the THC plus THF plus five Alpha THF. But this woman is not way off the mark. I've definitely seen lower than this looks like where she needs the most help, is in those catecholamines. Here's a 63 year old and ups. What is the you have here, with the optimal range between 150 and 200? Although if I see an adult who has above 100, I think they're doing pretty well. And the serotonin are 37.3 This person is not feeling well. And as by her own admission, She's depressed. And not only that, look at how low the catecholamines are. And that's rather dramatic as well. I mean, energy mood, not going to be good when you see numbers like that most likely, the GABA is fine and some other stimulatory neurotransmitters that aren't very good remarkable. This woman jumped right to a psychiatrist. And she had benefit from SSRIs. And it certainly would make sense to do. So now when I see low catecholamines, at the same time, I think more than just the rational SSRIs. I think of something that's the combination like Wellbutrin that's going to assist those catecholamines. And I've seen people thrive on something like Wellbutrin as well. And that would have been my choice. Where are we choosing a pharmaceutical for that woman? Here's a 60 year old, Caucasian female, she's tired, she's functioning and she's not happy. And look at that this is a more traditionally low serotonin. This is more common to see people who aren't who are a little tired and not happy with a serotonin. This is more reasonable than the previous patient. We saw a dramatic reduction in that serotonin. And then looking at the catecholamines. Oops, these are all low and how did they get there? I know I'm repeating myself. But this doesn't happen out of the blue, they don't have a disease called catecholamine and serotonin depletion syndrome. They have an excessive demands they've placed on their neurotransmitter production to rise up to do a profound biochemical resistant response to fight or flight and the stress in their life. And the real key to the highway here is not getting rid of their stress. This doesn't happen on earth. You don't say to a patient, I never said to a patient, go home and get rid of your stress, and you'll be fine. No, that isn't even the problem anyway, it's how they're responding to the stress. And you know, very often a wonderful devotion to therapy and learning and learning tools and implementing tools or whatever combination of groups, whatever you do, that's the remedy to change the nature of how you're responding to the stress in your life. And I do, I could pause on this one, and really emphasise it because it is so crucial. How are you going to get these things to repair, you're not going to be able to live on Better Living Through biochemistry eternally, you got to get it the cause. And the cause is a an intense response to the stress in someone's life. So they aquatic they need to acquire information, tools and support, all of which can be very beneficial. And there's millions and millions of people in the United States who've had a rough life. And it's a real stressors. And they did go into therapy. And they did go to Alcoholics Anonymous and the various groups that are available. They did study and learn and embrace their own spirituality, whatever form that happened to take, or the multi forms that that can take. And that's the ultimate cause of this is to create a good life and enjoy life. Basically, it doesn't going to insulate you from sums, ups and downs. No way. But it'll take you a million miles and I can be I'm a testimony for that.

But at any rate, here we go. This is garden variety, serotonin and catecholamine depletion. Why are millions of Americans on SSRIs because of profiles like this, and they be this will probably be another patient definitely recommend Wellbutrin for because it covers both the serotonin and the catecholamines. And then after treatment, things improved. And this improved enough that she was doing quite a bit better. And look, there's a rise in everything. And of sobs African substance there. She brought that up and Efrain close to normal. She brought the norepinephrine into normal range, and she brought that she improved the serotonin as well. And 90 is pretty respectable. 100 is quite respectable. And I do suspected that at 1.6 was giving her trouble on her serotonin levels and then GABA, nothing remarkable about the GABA here or the other stimulatory neurotransmitters and we treated this woman with amino acid formulations that contain tyrosine. Yeah, precursor to the catecholamines and five hydroxy tryptophane. Yeah, precursor to serotonin, a whole other approach with very good results. And what we knew about her is in the past, someone had wisely prescribed Wellbutrin to her and she appreciated Wellbutrin. And she was just looking for another way to handle this. And here's some of the biochemistry it's fascinating. This is the whole trip to Fein five hydroxy tryptophan cascade, and here is the production of the catecholamines beginning with the tyrosine. So it's amino acids and it takes vitamins and minerals to get us there. And GABA is a very important neurotransmitter, and it's biochemistry and then also histamine and then the ANA histamine is chemically it looks very similar to the histamine molecule. And then here's a nice chart that describes the fundamental characteristics of the various neurotransmitters. There's the biogenic amines and what whether they're excitatory or inhibitory. The amino acids GABA glycine wouldn't meet in the acetylcholine Of course, let us not forget in also serotonin and here's a pictorial description of how these neurotransmitters are being created near the synapse at the terminal end of a neuron in their excreted and they travel across that neuronal gap the synapse, and they activate receptor sites and then they're taken back up natural cycling process, we don't have to linger on that. And then I'm just showing some of the chemical relationships of the catecholamines here in here's an example of a 50 year old woman with anxiety and hyper arousal. And look at that glutamate that's in the red zone. That's an excessive amount, that's a stimulatory neurotransmitter as his histamine as his PA, and she's even got her norepinephrine. So look at that, that would be the profile of someone who is hyper aroused. And her GABA is a little low GABA is a calming neurotransmitter. So this woman, just for fun example, she took Xanax at one time and she quote, loved it. She would be a perfect candidate, if that's how you want to approach things. Now, Xanax is so addictive, and my God. I have so many things to say about the Xanax except in acute situations. And having helped people detoxify from the benzodiazepines. Oh my god, they're as addictive as anything comes. And it took some sophisticated this detoxification process to get a young woman who is way addicted to Xanax off of Xanax took years to do so we treated her with a GABA precursor. And this is her quote to me as she wanted to reorder my beloved Cabernet, she called it that's that's a proprietary blend of something that elevates the GABA. And I always love to hear it from patients. Nevermind what kind of idea that I have about whether something's good for him or not. I love rip comments like this where they know that this is good for them and they want it and she's been taking it for years.
