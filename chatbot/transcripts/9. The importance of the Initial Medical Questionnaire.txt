Let's talk about some basic information that's invaluable to have a butcher woman patient. The way we go about this is we have a questionnaire. And it's an extensive one. And it has some wonderful features. Right in the middle of that questionnaire, there's three females specific pages. And you'll find that quite detailed, gives you a lot of ideas about how woman's hormones behaved, and affected her earlier on in her life. I'm going to go zero in on this one a little bit for you. For those of you who are going to be working with this, I so much suggest that you go through are actually filling this one out. Let me show you what this does for us. What we focus in on this particular section of the female part of the questionnaire is on symptoms. For example, here I'm giving you symptoms of oestrogen deficiency, and I'm pointing out a scale that women can score this. And this is what they score, hot flashes, and here's what they score warm rushes. And that translates actually into totaling up and this whole section, this whole first section of this is on symptoms of oestrogen deficiency. This next section is on symptoms of oestrogen excess. And the next section is on symptoms of progesterone deficiency. And then finally, progesterone excess and testosterone deficiency. Now, what kind of history taking is this pretty odd, isn't it? But I learned that the more educated women can get as to what's going on with them. For one thing, they get some relief. They've been having these symptoms, they don't necessarily know it's menopause, they've might have a suspicion of it. And when they start seeing that some of these debilitating symptoms that they've been having, are actually due to hormonal insufficiencies or excesses. It gives them some relief. And the main motivation for organising it in this way, is we want women to understand what are symptoms of oestrogen deficiency, so that when they're determining their dose by starting low and gradually increasing, they get a sense of when they're alleviating symptoms of oestrogen deficiency, and also that they're falling shy of oestrogen excess. So we're using the questionnaire as an education tool for women to utilise later on in their process. Not the perfect science but very valuable clinically. And these will all add up and appear on a summary sheet. And the summary sheet can be converted to a PDF, and we're going to zero in on the female section of this summary sheet. And here you see that the oestrogen deficiency symptoms were totaled. So are the oestrogen excess, the progesterone deficiency the testosterone deficiency symptoms. In fact, this whole questionnaire is summarised on a summary sheet. As I was saying, it's an unconventional way to take a medical history but it sure serves the women and it's sure serves their process of getting good at alleviating their symptoms of insufficiency and excess
