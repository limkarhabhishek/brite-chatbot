I want to talk a little bit about iodine and the administration of iodine because it's become quite popular to, for people to supplement iodine anywhere from 12 and a half, or maybe six and a quarter to 50 milligrammes of iodine iodide comm combinations. And you know, when there's fibrocystic breast disease or increased breast density, it's fantastic. What it's able to accomplish is just so rewarding, not 100% of the time, no way. But my goodness, I've seen really what I would call medical miracles take place, with woman with women with long standing fibrocystic breast disease, breast tenderness, breast pain, et cetera, have that diminish? I mean, Dr. Wright, originally told me about some of the original work being done is which, which he was told was a foolproof treatment for fibrocystic breast diseases to actually paint the surface of the cervix with Iran, that was a treatment for fibrocystic breast disease back in the day. And yet now, we can take it by mouth very successfully Lagos Island, I had ions saturate SSK, high saturated solution of potassium iodide. And, yes, the brand name I overall, which I overall comes in be 12.5 to 50 milligrammes and what I'm wanting to express to you right now, and you can go through the slides if you want, but what it comes down to is these dosages that are routinely being used, and for not fibrocystic breast disease reasons, has been challenged by Dr. Allen gayby. And who's what I would consider him to be a very significant expert, and he's pointing out that the optimal intake of iodine may be 13.8 milligrammes a day that was determined by the Japanese study of humble was the intake of these Japanese who have rather rich levels of iodine, but he's questioning whether that's even real. And he's also saying that the amount that is given is between 80 and 333 times the RDA, when you're dealing with 12 and a half to 15 milligrammes per day and is that okay? And it really helped me remember that. When I was in medical school and someone was hyperthyroid. Boy, they had large glands goitres. And they had a tremendous amount of circulation to those glands. And surgeons were very reluctant to operate on them right away. They wanted to quiet that gland down. They wanted to quiet the circulation down, they wanted to calm the gland down and what they used to suppress the thyroid prior to operating on it was iodine, get the association there. Surgeons routinely administering Lugoff and SSK AI to reduce a hyper thyroid goitre overactive producing way too much hormone and it was uncontrollable. And so they did partial thyroidectomy. So total thyroidectomy knees. And they quieted that gland down before the operation, which was much their preference much easier to operate something that isn't haemorrhaging all over the place. And what did they use iodine. So this is what Dr. Gabriel is cautioning. And the moral of the story is, iodine over dose can be problematic and thyroid function should be monitored if you're treating with over a milligramme a day. So that's not hard. I mean, I periodically test thyroid at least annually. And then in someone that I've gotten on substantial doses of I overall, I'm going to test them more often than annually because we want to be sure that they are not suppressing their own thyroid gland. And so you test when thyroid levels become excessive, you can wind up increasing sex hormone binding globulin. So sooner or later, you're going to run across and elevated sex hormone binding globulin. And the critical consequences. There are these are tough patients to manage with their ovarian hormones or they can be tough. And they're a story and I want to remind you that whenever you run into a complicated case or a challenging case, because you're members of the menopause method, you can have no charge consultations with me just send me an email and give me some variety of times to choose from an RSVP and we'll discuss your challenging cases for no charge. But whenever you run into a challenging case, you're going to find a certain significant percentage of them are going to have to do with elevated sex hormone binding globulin, so I mentioned it with thyroid, because we want to be cautious around excessive thyroid doses to begin with. Unfortunately, very few people tolerate excessive thyroid doses. They get hyper, their pulse goes up, they get palpitations, they get tremors, they feel like they're on eight cups of coffee. So there's all kinds of built in protections there. I want to tell you about A 57 year old Gravatt a zero white female one of her most significant problems was obsessive compulsive disorder. Definitely. She had had a history oophorectomy years before and she was slightly overweight. And when I first tested her she was 57. And take a look at those numbers, those thyroid numbers, TSH, 6.2, for that woman is hypothyroid unless proven otherwise, which is not going to prove otherwise. Men are free T four was words the lower range of normal as was her free T three, we treated her with 100 micrograms and she took her last dose or preceding dose, 24 hours previous to the blood draw and look at her TSH, which is more of a reflection of long term thyroid at least three weeks minimum, and it's low. Now. It's interesting. A lot of people that you treat with thyroid are gonna wind up with lowish TSH is and I've learned especially on the advice of Dr. gayby that it's fine, it happens very easily clinically, to get that TSH to low you don't want it to go too low, you're really what you're doing is you're shutting off the glands production. So it's a balance between getting the free T four and the free T three levels decent in the patient clinically feeling well. And getting that TSH, which by numbers could get your concern up. I'm not concerned by a TSH of 0.01. And someone we're having a treat. And look what happened here though. There's more information here that free T for is 1.4. Well, that's within the range. But you know what 1.4 is a little higher than we see even in young people 1.2 More the upper limit there. And the free T three is 3.8. Yeah, that's still within range. But that's higher than what we see in young people. And not only that, let's throw in the fact that you're drawing the blood on this person 24 hours after their preceding dose, they didn't take their morning thyroid yet. So this would be what I would call a little bit of excessive dosage. Not so excessive that it pushed that reverse T three outside of reference range, but it will, sooner or later. This is in gross excessive treatment. But it's enough to want to quiet this down. So is this okay? Yeah, not so much. And so looking at treating examples. Here's the how this worked out. This woman began with a TSH of 6.24, and a three to four of one and a free T three of 2.2. These aren't alarming numbers there. But they're interesting numbers. And this particular patient treatment brought her up to 1.4 and 3.80. That's 24 hours after that last dose, that seems excessive, drop the TSH. And of course, I just showed you the example of the actual lab report on this patient. And I'm just giving you graphic information on what it's like in an having header last T for dose, 24 hours previous. That's overdose. So we want to back that down. No big deal. And here's some examples. And I'm not actually going to go into the details of those. But what I want you to see is the rule that says T for dose. And notice how we're starting off at 50. We're getting her up to 87.5 of t for up to 100. And then she's going back down. She got hyper on 100 Hyper on 87 and a half then she feels better on 50. And my question is, is that going to last? Because we had to control was 50 in March of 2015. And what's going on here, a little bit ups the downs he's with the dosages, whenever I see this kind of Aratus ism in the dosage and the needs increase in decrease. I think it's time to test the thyroid antibodies. This isn't the only indication to test the thyroid antibodies by fire tender gland is or a dosage that's tough to get clinically. I mean one of the most significant patients I've had in this regard, she was a woman in her 40s She was hyper and hypo meaning she was oscillating. And this is before I really understood this. And then then we detected that she had autoimmune thyroiditis and auto and then I realised that this was what was behind the eroticism. And this woman is as intelligent as they come and very capable of isolating dosages and adjusting dosages with no problem. In fact, she was scientifically oriented to so many patients are and so she was fine to do trying to customise those for how she felt and try and ride the ups and even out the ups and downs. And she couldn't do it and after two years, we eventually opted for partial thyroidectomy but the only thing I really want to illustrate here is that if you're seeing erratic issues if You haven't tested before for the thyroid antibodies do so because you might have an autoimmune thyroiditis
