I'd like to talk to you about melatonin. I'm not going to go into an extensive dissertation about melatonin, but it's a hormone. And it has interaction with the ovarian hormones. In fact, it's felt to be preventive against some of the reproductive cancers. Oh, my goodness. And melatonin is so great. I mean, it's the brain's premier antioxidant. There are other antioxidants that help the brain protect the brain from excessive oxidation. But melatonin is the premier one. So and melatonin tends to decline with stress is everything else does and over time. So melatonin is such an easy intervention. And it's very easy to work with. I mean, here is a three point there are 4.5 Point celebrate testing of melatonin. And it's not hard to do with saliva. And here's a classic example where the 1am that's the wrong time to have a very low melatonin, course they are low at the other times that they were tested. So there we have living proof that this patient would most likely benefit from melatonin. But it's been a long time since I've done one of these because it's such an easy a clinical test to do. For one thing, it speaks loudly that if you have overdose, you're going to feel it and you're going to report it. And the main thing that I error that I find people must be making out there in the streets is I'm a 200 pound guy without real sensitivities to medications, and I tolerate half a milligramme of melatonin really well. And one milligramme That might be my optimal dose. But if I go up to one and a half, I'm gonna wake up we're having had intense dreams and be groggy the next day. And what you buy over the counter so often is a three milligramme melatonin. So I'm asserting that a lot of people are shooting right through that therapeutic window. And I'm recommending that you start out dose determining with a half a milligramme capsule, or of course, it's always available in liquid forms as well, and this one has point one three milligrammes per drop, so, you can do some fancy titrating with that, and the advantage to that is there are some people who 0.5 milligrammes is too much for them. And you know, you're sensitive patients, and this is one area, they're liable to be too sensitive, and what are they going to tell you? I had to rent tremendously horrible dreams and I woke up groggy, or they'll even get a paradoxical effect and the melatonin will wake them up. Because, you know, pharmacological curves, lots of different things can happen in there, and especially to those who don't have the standard pharmacological window. So mainly, start low and gradually increase as you're determining the dose. And yes, some people are going to wind up, referring three milligrammes of melatonin six milligrammes of melatonin, and there's even what's considered to be therapeutic dosage of melatonin at 10 milligrammes, but what I'm saying is, I find it easiest, and I'm just giving you my best shot. You may have your own preferences in this regard, but I start with five tenths of a milligramme and I'll go up to one one and a half milligrammes, maybe even two milligrammes with my patients, and most of them are content somewhere within that range. And again, occasionally, sometimes I got to start out with much less melatonin, and sometimes there's long acting forms of melatonin, and they're going to work better for people, and I mean it, what is it? It's in about individualization and you have your basic toolkit and you have your outlying ancillary tools that you're going to need to use with a certain percentage of patients. And again, melatonin in excess usually speaks pretty loudly. People reporting God I was my dreams were in Super technicolour and a little bit too intense for my liking. And I woke up groggy
