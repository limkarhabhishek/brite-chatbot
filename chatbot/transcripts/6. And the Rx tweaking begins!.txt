We're exploring the checklists, which can be so valuable for your practice and menopause medicine. And having addressed the first consultation, we're now moving into the second consultation. And again, I recommend that you put that checklist on a chart, because there's so many steps to remember. So you just check them off, it'll really support you and not leaving anything out, have quite an extensive process. And during that second consultation, once again, it begins with what you do prior to that consultation a lot easier, a lot simpler. I learned over the course of time that there's a certain set basic amount of information that I want to know from my woman patient, when she shows up for that second consultation. I mean, we want to know exactly what hormones is she on where she applying them to the to her skin, or two or mucous membranes, as she specifies, because there was initial instructions, but we want to learn, did she follow those initial instructions? Are she applying them somewhere else? And does she have any symptoms of hormone insufficiency or hormonal access that are remaining? And so we put all those questions in a simple questionnaire, it's one page long. And prior to every single phone consultation, follow up office consultation, we email a link to that questionnaire, once again, it exists on a secure portal if you'd like. But there we are, there they are, they're showing up at that second visit, or any future consultation with the one page of the kind of information that I found absolutely essential that I wanted to know for every single one of those consultations, that doesn't mean I don't have other questions, or do I want to know more, but there's a base camp of information. And that question you're really provides it? And what do you do during that second consultation, it's you review that follow up, question your line item by line item. And recall from the initial consultation, you may have asked for some additional labs or imaging. So you want to review that. And on that follow up questionnaire, you want to review any symptoms that they have. And then with all that information, you're going to calculate a new prescription. because invariably, that first prescription is not going to serve for the ongoing prescriptions. And in order to do that there's enough math involved that we're going to teach you the long hand of that math if you don't already know it in the remainder of the menopause method educational videos, but we've simplified it, we put it on these automated calculators, they exist in the Members section. And for that second consultation, there is a specific calculator that you can put in automatically. Once you prescribe the first time and given the information. It'll just recalculate the new prescription, which you can print out and a hand to your front desk for them to submit to the pharmacy because the likelihood of the milligrammes per millilitre, the biassed and the milligrammes per millilitre, with progesterone in the form of progesterone is quite likely to change during that second consultation, and then also during that second consultation in anticipation of the future, you give out a hormone test kit, the 24 hour urine hormone test kit, and I explain in detail why, at this phase of knowledge. In menopause medicine, the way to go is that 24 Urine hormone test is a way to assess what's actually going on in a woman and I go into details about that later. Or you just email the lab and have them ship that kit to that patient. And you give the instructions to the patient. Number one, some of the details that are important to communicate to the patient, and how to do that 24 hour urine hormone test, and then also when to do it. The optimal time to do it, is if in the third month, she's going, oh my goodness, I think I figured this out, I feel good. That's when you want her to take that test. Or there will be exceptions, where it'll be challenging to figure out exactly what's going on with her. So you'll need the more information in which case you'll do that test at that time. And we'll probably need a follow up test to confirm that when she does arrive at the optimal doses. And why I'm linger on this a little bit because the calculation of when to schedule. The third consultation is not exactly is written in stone. It depends. When she says that she's arrived at the optimal dosage is by alleviation of symptoms. If that's four weeks, you schedule it for she does the test at four weeks, you schedule it for six weeks, if it's at five weeks, you schedule it for seven weeks, because once she ships that to the lab, even though it's overnighted to the lab, it We'll be about five business days before we have the actual test result. So when to schedule. The third consultation is a little bit to be determined. And it's why I say that when you write that second prescription, which will last for a month, you want to include one refill, because she may have to go a little bit beyond the month. That's the second consultation for you
