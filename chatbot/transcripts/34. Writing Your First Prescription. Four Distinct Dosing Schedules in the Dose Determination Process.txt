And then as for the actual prescription of progesterone Well, the first prescription for biassed again I'm saying again 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, and we're specifying the organic oil there by eau de TDA. They have millilitres and the SIG is for them to be able to write that on the bottle. And especially for insurance companies, if you're dealing with a campaigner that can accept insurance, they're pretty rare those folks, you'd go between one and three drops, topical bi D to the software arms. That gives you the latitude



00:35

to do the whole gross discovery process. And we don't have them write this in the bottle, but I'm reminding you to do not dose higher than three drops bi D prior to testing, and then as far as progesterone goes, this is the starting prescription, 200 milligrammes per millilitre and the organic oils, that's again, the O and DTD, eight and a half millilitres and you could put a sing in there, too, if they need a cig, as if they're using their insurance to to six drops, topical HS to the inner thighs because we're going to give them a more specific dose determination schedule. And when I when we come to those, you'll you'll see what I mean, and don't hide don't dose higher than six drops prior to testing. And then just for completeness, I am giving you an example of what happens when you want to prescribe something and carbopol a common one is two and a half milligrammes per millilitre and the common is 90 millilitres although some pharmacists are cutting way down in that because they don't want more than a month prescription and don't hide don't dose higher than three pumps and don't dose higher than you can start off with 30 milligrammes per millilitre, you could do 100 milligrammes, you could do more,



01:48

but 45 millilitres in one to three pumps, topical HS to the inner thighs, I'm gonna get more specific about where you apply progesterone. Now, this particular slide is up there. I haven't used this approach in 10 years. But I want to have it up there for completeness, in case you ever have to turn to the gels and there are times when you do, but certainly not initially, I don't start out with the gels. Now, I want to specify how we assist our women. And if you're seeing this particular video you have prescribed to the menopause method. So you have access to all of these tools. And this is one of my another one of my favourite tools, why to make it easier.



02:34

So we have four different possible dose discovery protocols. And the one we call the most common starting dose, we call it the second method, the lighter starting dose, the third algorithm the enhanced so there's three possibilities. And then we have a fourth one that's customised, where you fill in all the blanks, yourself, and let's discuss one of these, the most common starting dose, you hand these patients that card, they come in our starter kits, and these kits are no charge to you. And then what's in there is we're specifying the frequency of dose increase, and so on days one to seven, we're saying start with one drop of biassed in the morning, and one drop of bias in the evening. And then two drops of progesterone in the



03:24

note that there's more progesterone than then there is bias will actually adds up to the same. Not that you're going to need to dose discover these as independent variables. Just because you have two drops of bias total doesn't mean you need two drops of progesterone, they actually behave independently. But this is a regimen for at least to get you started on it to get your patients started on it. And then on days eight to 14, the second week you make a change, where really what you're doing is you're increasing the pm dose, a bias to two drops, you remain one drop in the morning or increase the pm of the bias to two and you increase the HS progesterone to three drops. And then the next step with that card. And of course this goes on to the third week and the fourth week. I just didn't specify that there. And then the next step you take with that card is there happens to be a perforation there, you give the bottom part to the patient and there's their dose discovery roadmap, at least it's very substantial guidelines for them. And then you take off the top of the card and you fill in the name and date for your patient. And you hand that to their front desk. So that gives them the information they need to fax in that initial prescription. Now, for the sensitive women. We're not calling it sensitive dose. We're calling it the lighter starting dose. And the doses are reduced for women who bodies are super sensitive to everything like I've specified to you or for women whose bodies have not seen hormones for some time. So on days one to seven, we're starting out with zero bias in the morning. In fact the only bias they're getting as well.



05:00

dropping the evening. So what does that amount to half the dose of the most common starting dose. And we start out with one drop of progesterone in the evening, because they're sensitive, we want to see how they're going to behave, how they're going to respond to that. And then on days eight to 14, we are going to add in that morning bias dose, if they tolerate the one drop of bias and one drop of progesterone, the evening we're going to increase that and they haven't alleviated their symptoms, we're going to start by increasing not the nocturnal bias, which are already doing one drop in the evening, we're going to start them in the morning drop, because we're always wanting to be ID dosing, and then we increase that progesterone drop in that second week to two and that goes on that regimen keeps on increasing in that manner. And then there's a third regimen, and we call it the enhanced starting prescription. These are for women who are early on in the pre menopause or early on in menopause where their bodies are very recently used to substantial



05:57

oestrogen dosages. And so we don't want to necessarily go as in the same rate that we did with women who are not so recent as these as these folks. So these women's bodies are used to robust hormone levels in the timing and dosages are accelerated. So on days one to four, we start off with one drop in the morning and biassed and one drop in the evening. And just like we did with the most common and we do three drops of progesterone in the evening. But what is different here is the rate of acceleration increases. So we've now moved to days five to nine. That's not to say we haven't even made it to the second week, when we're already doing an increase to two drops of bias in the evening. And we're increasing that progesterone to five drops. So we're getting more aggressive with that progesterone right away. And eventually we're going to increase that the pm progesterone, a six drops, we're not going to go higher than that. And then there's a fourth regimen that comes in the starter kit. And this is for those of you you want to make the whole thing up you see special circumstances you want to write in, what days you prescribe to them and all the dosages you're gonna write all those in by hand, a simple tool to help your patients as they walk out the door with their marching instructions. They've got that card in hand and they go okay, that's pretty clear. I get my my bottles in my card, and I know how to do my regimen.
