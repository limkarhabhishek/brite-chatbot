Well, here's an article by a clinical professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Dr. Altman, who wrote a editorial about dealing with this. And he's talking about bioidentical hormones and what's fact and what's favourable. And he's really addressing what had been brought to his attention about Super physiologic dosage levels. And I've got more about this in the appendix three B. But let me summarise what Dr. Altman and I found to be the most germane from his articles. He's really addressing the practice that's still going on of perpetuating menstruation and menopause. And it's really referring to these graphs I've just showed you. And he's saying that excessive breast breast density is a known risk factor for breast cancer. And there's a comparative there's some showing some increased breast density. Also incessant ovulation is a risk factor for breast cancers, as I pointed out quite a while ago. And mammary epithelial proliferation occurs with each cycle. Beginning with the restoration of hormones in a cycle of oestrogen for example, you start proliferating blessed glandular tissue and possible preparation for conception and ultimate breastfeeding. And if you don't impregnate and you get a fertilised ovum, everything reverses, and you get deeper liberation that goes on cycle after cycle after cycle. But the point here is you get actual histologic cellular proliferation during a woman's menstrual cycle, and Dr. Altman is declaring that are proliferating breast cells differ from cancer cells, only at that they stop proliferating. So that's the crucial thing, they better stop proliferating, and it's well known in the risk story for breast cancers, the more menstrual cycles a woman has over a lifetime, the more chance a normal proliferating cell will mutate. And that's what we're really dealing with mitosis and apoptosis, that delicate balance, how was it occurring? And then we're dealing with the issue that I pointed out earlier on, that a breast cancer cell going to sell to identifiable lesion can take 10 to 15 years to be found. So what Dr. Altman is stating that recreating cycles in menopause, a woman puts them at risk. Why am I addressing this? I'm never recommending in the world of shoe we have a very light dose of hormone restoration or a very robust dose. We're definitely in this area. Because all everything that I've learned from the medical literature and from my experience is it doesn't take much to do great things for bones, for brains for arteries for vagina for bladders, it just doesn't take that much. Not because I'm making that up in my mind, I refer you to the medical literature citations that I have about each one of those issues. How much does it take for bones? How much does it take for cognitive function? How much does it take for arteries? It's all in there in the literature this, like I said early on, when I was discussing risk, there may be a lot of challenges in interpreting the medical literature. And the yes and yes, there is and no, it won't. Phenomena takes place there. But there's also a lot of fabulous information in there. So the what we consider to be the most poignant thing for us to remember is want to reduce risk. Want to get it as close to zero as possible. Don't overdose with oestrogen therapy. And here's Dr. Lam pointing out some factors about a modern menopause at the age of onset of menses 100 years ago used to be 16 Men archy. Today, it's 12. We can give you reasons why that's happened. Perhaps you can guess what amount of those hours. And the average age of onset of pregnancy was. They were a lot earlier and more frequent than they are today. There's a lot later and there's less children and the amount of lactation that takes place is there was a lot of time spent in lactation 100 years ago. And it was it today. It's relatively seldom even though there is a whole cadre of women who are that have emerged in the course of my lifetime that are devoted to breastfeeding. And that's been a major change from when I was growing up. But there's still in comparison to everyone on Earth. It's still relatively seldom occurrence. And then the number of cycles per lifetime or 100 years ago, per lifetime there was between 102 100 Now there's between 350 and 400. And like Dr. Almond pointed out the more the cycles, the more the monthly mitosis to take place, the more chance mathematical chance there is for a genetic change and the development of a breast cancer cell incessant menstruation has been associated with increased occurrence of conditions, including infertility, cancer, fibroids, anaemia, migraines and endometriosis. Absolutely. So when we stopped to consider Should we continue menstruation into menopause? No. The moral of the oestrogen story is clinical symptoms are valuable and dose determination, as I pointed out to right at the beginning of this whole presentation, but just because a woman is applying the average amount of oestrogen does not mean that her total body oestrogen levels are fine is revealed by testing. And often enough dosages correlate well with the 24 hour urine hormone test values. And at times, they do not correlate. That means the woman could be applying a certain dose and she's not getting enough hormones in her body. She's testing lower than the bottom limit the eight micrograms per 24 hours or she's getting too much. And she's testing above the optimal of 14 micrograms per 24 hours. high doses do not always equal high total potent estrogens. And lowest doses could equal robust, total potent estrogens. Absorption can be a mighty variable, and that's the bottom line these absorptive differences, and especially in the skin, that's the health of the skin of a younger woman, as opposed to someone who's a little older. And bottom line, beware of dosages of 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol, equivalent, or higher. And I've signalled this out is one of these significant pieces of information, it takes you down to the bottom line, it all translates into if you're testing, you're going to be just fine. The moral of the hormone story is test everybody, you'll be just fine. Once you start doing testing, you start seeing the results and how they correlate clinically, and how to tweak patients hormone programmes. You're gonna rest solid into knowing Hey, I've got the whole thing covered. These 24 hour urine hormone tests are just so terrific. Another moral of the oestrogen story is refrain from restoring oestrogen to youthful or beyond youthful levels, you do not need to. What the literature has shown us is the very things that you want for a woman to achieve bones, brain, arteries, vagina bladder muscles like me to achieve with quite low levels, and certainly lower than youthful levels, refrain from continuing or restoring menstrual cycles. If you want to restore or just continue a woman menstruating is going to take you between three to five times the upper limit of the normal dosages and a young woman. It's going to take between three and eight times the upper limit of normal of the test and total potent estrogens. Got that. I mean, if you want to keep it very going, you're not going to necessarily catch it unless you really know your numbers that it's going to take between three and eight times the upper limit of normal tested total potent estrogens in a young healthy menstruating woman, three to eight times the upper limit and test everybody
