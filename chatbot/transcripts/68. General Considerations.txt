Now I want to discuss what I consider to be a very, very important part of the process. And it's the annual follow up consultation, this will pretty much complete the treating women and menopause with bioidentical hormones. And this is a very important part of it, we use a medical tether, we make sure that that annual consultation takes place, we schedule it at the time of the final initial visits, and we only write prescriptions that will last a year. And we can determine that pretty much we can't do it perfect. If they start using less, they can go longer. But I call that the medical tether, because what will happen is the pharmacy is going to fax me a request, saying that they run out of refills. And when I renew the prescription, and we have an easy way to check our records, when we go lower, when I see one of those from the pharmacy, I go UPS time for the annual consultation is the most likely cause. And so we just go through the process of implementing that annual consultation. And the annual visit in our practice is mandatory. And prior to that visit, we email a link to the patient. And this is a different this is the annual follow up questionnaire, it looks a lot. In fact, two thirds of it is exactly the same questionnaire is the initial follow up questionnaire. And then there's some additional information we want to know in our review that as far as this annual visit goes, if you remember there was a series of agreements that the patient had to sign prior to in my practice, me being willing to see them for the very first consultation. And that series of agreements, which is also on the website, and you can use that series of agreements and your certified programme, we want you to use that series of agreements. And what did that include? They're signing on prior to that first visit, that if they're going to embark upon this process with us, if they want to stay with us, they may want to not stay with me. But if they want to stay with us that what they have to do is they have to sign on to an annual consultation that has a series of requirements for it. And one thing we make sure is the women stays up to date on the mammogram or thermogram, if necessary, bone mineral density transvaginal ultrasound is necessary and an annual 24 hour urine hormone test and appropriate blood tests. Now, how frequent you need to get the mammogram, bone density, et cetera, that's determined patient by patient. But they're signing that beforehand. So there's no there's there's full disclosure right in the beginning. So they're not surprised a year later. And how did I develop this? Because I failed to do this in the very early days in my practice. And I'd say to a woman, Okay, it's time for your mammogram. She said, Oh, no, no, I don't do mammograms. And by that time I had learned, that doesn't feel okay to me. And there I was in a sticky wicket. But as soon that's when I developed the agreements. And so I said, Well, I don't know if you remember, but you actually signed an agreement. Here it is. We show it to you, where you agreed to do mammograms at the appropriate rate and as determined by me. And so this annual consultation, they're not surprised by it, because they know that they signed on to it in the beginning, the first page and a half are identical to the follow up visit questionnaire. And then it's got some additional stuff. And this is at the lower end of this questionnaire. And it's got the we're really talking about blood tests, and one was their last what date it was the date of their last last blood test. And was there any comments about it? Was there anything abnormal in it and when was their last 24 year in hormone test? When was their last gynecologic exam, which they signed up for? And that initial agreement field their last transvaginal ultrasound the last mammogram and there's any comments that are germane to that last mammogram or their last breast ultrasound, or last breast thermogram which one was it and were there anything uncovered by that? And their last bone density and any other comments that they want to make? And then they click on that and that goes automatically to the secure website, the HIPAA secure HIPAA approved website, any menopause method, physician can set up your own portal, and you're the only one who has access to the patient information in that portal. Or you can set up that portal. You can just create a PDF out of that patient who's that's where their questionnaire landed when they press the submit button. You can create a PDF out of that and add that into your your medical records already. So let's in this annual follow up visit, it's important for a lot of reasons for one thing big cuz I'd still say we're in the phase of historical experiment where women are getting treated with hormones. Because the record keeping in the data is just amassing. And yet we still don't know. The final answers aren't in on several questions in the world of treating women in menopause. And because of this, I say that it's one reason why yearly ongoing monitoring is very important. For the hormones are potent, you know about it. Our literature challenges their safety. I've spoken at length about this. And of course, we want you to become familiar with our literature. And the breast screening methods have false negatives. For example, I have a woman who actually I'd been training for a couple years she had a negative thermogram. She had a negative screening mammogram, and her astute gynaecologist because she was getting her female exams from her traditional gynaecologist. He felt the lump and he didn't feel comfortable with the negative mammogram. And he sent her for an MRI, and by God that was a breast cancer, and removed at a very small size with no metastases, it brings tears to my eyes. How this was picked up, I know this woman very well, this is why you're recommending a checklist here, just like the pilots do. And just like the surgeons do, we want to have this checklist followed in this annual follow up is very much a part of it, the transvaginal ultrasound may be needed a time, these are the reasons for this annual follow up, and our knowledge grows and experience grows. And it leads to method changes all the time. There isn't one year this transpired in my two decades of doing this, with the women that they were something new hasn't been added even this year. And one of the reasons that this is a we're filming the whole educational series, after two and a half years of the previous filming, which was a update of a previous one of those is because that knowledge from two and a half years ago solid as a rock, but our methods and some of the stuff I've learned I've increased so much. That's one of the reasons we re filming the whole thing. So that's going to happen to you too. You send a woman out the door a year ago, and in that year, you your experience and what you've learned may have increased so substantially that you realise that you want to see or for the new method as well. This is again reasons why do we do this annual follow up
