I now like to focus in on estrogens. And as far as reducing risk goes with estrogens, we want to be using the right preparation, the right formula, the right ratio, the right route and the right base. And we don't want to overdose. And we want to be able to identify and treat oestrogen dominance, which is unacceptable over the long run. And of course, we want to get progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, etc, right? And we want to test these hormones. And then we'll do annually, a monitoring of the breast uterus bones or female patient or hormones, everything, just as an overview of what it takes to reduce the risk. And as far as estrogens go, I want to delve deeply into what preparations are available, what routes of administration are available, the formulations, the base that's being used, the dosages that are being used, the prescriptions that you have to write, the topical application, and the testing and monitoring. These are the subjects I want to cover in estrogens. Let's start with the preparations. There is a right oestrogen preparation, and what is it and in what form and from what source? Well, in the beginning, there was the oral conjugated estrogens. These are decades and decades old. These are one of the best selling pharmaceutical medications in the country in the world, happened to be Premarin conjugated equine estrogens in the 1.25 milligramme, Premarin and there are also other dosages available and then also estradiol valerate in a two milligramme preparation. These things were non bio identical. They're conjugated equine estrogens, their sources horse urine, and we say more about it in the appendix and what quote one of those sources Premarin is a complex mix of more than 30 oestrogen compounds 22 and a half to 32 and a half percent is aqualen sulphate which is not even found in humans in the quote, the potency is not adequately categorised. And blood and urine levels are not testable by ordinary women were be given these hormones without ever testing them. And for a time permanent was the top selling prescription drug in the United States. This one of my office managers was once doodling in his desk and this actually went into the first edition in the second edition of our book in that's an awkward moment if the chance encounter of Sally and the source of her prescription, or you choose bio identical, the source is plant because plants turn out the exact same molecules of oestrogen and progesterone testosterone as we do, how different are we from plants? And these are molecule identical. They're the same estriol and estradiol molecules that the plants produce. They're accurately testable in blood in urine, most importantly, in urine. Why in the world? would we not want to use these molecularly identical hormones that are coming from plants? They're ground up by your local friendly compounding pharmacist? Well, not exactly. I'm just joking there. These are extracted through highly precise methods by the pharmaceutical manufacturer, who are their initial output of the hormones. These aren't the ones that they're went up with, ultimately, but their initial output is very pure molecularly identical hormones and then the compounding pharmacist by significant quantities of the pure estriol the pure estradiol, the pure testosterone, etc. They put them up in transdermal applications, transmucosal capsules, et cetera. So just to cut to the chase, you will find me very opinionated. Doesn't mean I'm always right, but I certainly have strong opinions about this. And to me the right hormones to administer to women in menopause are bio identical
