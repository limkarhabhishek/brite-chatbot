Why do people have thyroid issues? Duh. Because the human race has evolution challenges has forever since we've been around and is both caught up in and caught by and emerging from a primitive consciousness, which is the source of most distress and most illness a primitive consciousness, otherwise known in many instances is unconsciousness. The complex thoughts and emotions and actions that often trigger a chronic super ramped up, overactive, biologically consequential stress response. There we are, again, the biology the physiology, the biochemistry, of the fight or flight is why people get over glandular demands in that they can't keep up with and that they eventually tire or fatigue or whatever word you want to use, and to where they can't keep up with the requirements of the inelegant response to stress and the widespread and beneficial untoward consequences of not being fully awake and fully conscious. We all know how that plays out in our individual lives. And that leads eventually to glandular depletion that leads to lessened output. And you wind out you might end up with less than useful levels of whatever hormone you're talking about, including the thyroid. And here's some comments from the medical literature. This is subclinical thyroid disease review, and guidelines for diagnosis and management. There's controversy out there. Absolutely. Patients with serum thyroid stimulating hormones level outside the reference range, and levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine within the reference range are common in clinical practice. You betcha. What are you going to do about that? What if you have an a TSH, that's five rather than within the reference range of four? What if you have a TSH? That's 2.5? That's well within the reference range. What does that significant are these reference ranges built on? There's the ticket statistical analyses of the American laboratory going public, many of whom are not feeling well, and many of whom are the hypothyroid. So there's, this is what I was trying to point out earlier with the estrogens as these reference ranges are problematic. And you've got to do an internal adjustment. So that you get because as far as I know, there have not been good studies in the world of menopause. And we tried to do one once and we got into some technical difficulties of testing young, healthy women, and trying to see build reference ranges around what they produce. And what we one of the things we find out is their reference ranges are really wide. And the other thing we did and we selected college students nursing students to test is Oh, my God, they're, their reference ranges were really wide too, because a lot of them are stressed up the gizzard, you can imagine, because they're nursing students. Nursing curricula is quite intense in a good university. So best laid plans of mice. And researchers can gang after ugly, ugly, I don't know. Well, anyway, there's no necessity for further evaluation and possible treatment and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established. That's what this particular reference says. And I would challenge that, and so many of you are as well, because you many of you have delved deeply into treating men and women with thyroid, you know the value, and you're not going to necessarily accept the traditional criteria that we all grew up with and learned about. So the conclusion so this particular study, as we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in the ranges that are 4.5 to 10, they call that minimal. Oh, no, I put this slide up here, not because I believe in it at all. I don't. But I want to tell you what some of the traditional teachings still is. And this is what they're recommending, don't treat these folks with minimal elevations with TSH, or above 4.5, even up to 10. know, when I see a TSH of 2.5, I'm beginning to wonder, why is this pituitary gland putting out a robust amount what I would consider a robust amount of TSH? Is it because it's trying to stimulate this thyroid gland for a reason. So again, reference range issues. And here's one of the prevailing opinions and I know I'm lingering on this that it's but this is what you're going to meet and this is what you're getting the flack you're gonna get if you attempt to treat these hypothyroid patients, but disregard it as far as I'm concerned, respectfully disregarded. It's bogus. But I want to tell you what's out there and what traditional physicians and why you might come under criticism. And here's a quote from this is not certain whether it's necessary to treat subclinical hypothyroidism at all, the study in this issue of Jama suggest the treatment might be warranted, especially if the blood TSH levels above 10. Huh? How about above? Four, for sure. or above three, almost certain, or above two, very often. Now, I want to give you a different point of view. And this is a very extensive test. The Colorado thyroid disease prevalence study. This is the participants is a supposedly Healthy People and the prevalence of elevated TSH Above 5.1 is 9.5%. In a, quote, healthy population. Whoa, that's a lot of people. The mean total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein why they mentioned in that with thyroid, well, I've already mentioned that you can get elevated cholesterol just from insufficient thyroid. And the levels of subjects with TSH values between 5.1 and 10. were significantly greater. There it is documented benefit. We're saying that, hey, check out the cholesterol. Well, here it is in a recent study showing that they're paying attention that they're seeing that if you get a TSH between five and 10, you can see an elevated cholesterol, and the symptoms are reported more often in hypothyroid versus euthyroid individuals. Yeah, and among patients taking thyroid medication, only 60% were within the normal range of the TSH. In other words, were they under treated these results confirm that thyroid dysfunction is common. And that's the main thing that this study wanted to point out and may often go undetected and may be associated with adverse health outcomes. Yeah, that can be avoided by serum TSH measurement. Thyroid hormones affect on sex hormones. ganando. Steroids exert their effect on thyroid function primarily by altering the clearance of thyroxin binding globulin. Isn't it fascinating? How this is so interrelated oestrogen administration, causes an increase in serum TBG concentration and androgen therapy results in a decrease in this binding protein. So I'm putting out the interrelations and you know, once again, even though we're going into the technical details here, what's going to matter to you is you pay attention to all the hormones, you assess them through the testing that works best for them. And, and by the way for thyroid hormone, I do not rely on 24 hour urines. I don't even request that the the free T three and 24 hour urines. Because the T four and 24 are urines is thought to be not terrifically reliable. No, I use serum tests for thyroid evaluation. And you can put that picture together with a patient's clinical picture in the serum test, which I find to be highly reliable. So serum tests is what I'm recommending. And you probably already do this and know this for the evaluation of thyroid in 24 hour urine hormone test for the ovarian hormones plus adrenal hormones plus others. So despite ganando steroids induce changes in serum TBG concentration subjects with normal thyroid glands, maintain clinical and biochemical euthyroid ism, and changes in their serum free thyroid action, or thyroid stimulating hormone levels. So you can have Ganatra store, steroid influence and TBG. But you can still maintain normal thyroid levels. In contrast, the administration of ganando steroids to patients with thyroid diseases, causes significant biochemical and clinical alterations requiring changes in the doses of thyroid medication. Do you have to remember this technical point now, and I know I'm repeating myself, the only thing you have to remember is do thyroid tests, good ones and all of your patients and do 24 hour urines and your patients to evaluate the adrenals and the covariance or testicular hormones and you'll be fine and recreate balance and replenish when you need to. And you got to pay attention to the binding globulin, slow and that's why I keep bringing mine here because some of the pitfalls, some of the things that physicians miss is an errant.

Otherwise an increased or decreased binding globulin, especially in the world of sex hormone binding globulin, and what I'm bringing out here is it also can be affect affect the thyroid binding globulin. So that's why I do a routine every single patient sex hormone binding globulin, and also ganando steroid therapy, may unmask thyroid illness in previously undiagnosed subjects. And this is a takeaway that's quite important. It would be prudent to assess thyroid function subjects with thyroid disease. Six to eight weeks after go now steroid administering Shouldn't are withdrawal. Very important there because you're treating a woman in menopause? And this is great. And three months into it, has it affected anything else like is it affected thyroid hormone or thyroid binding globulin? You want to find out because you can change that road function by restoring decent ovarian hormones. This is what this is coming down to. So the seal of significance. Now appearing on your screen is saying, after you treat with oestrogen for a few months, consider checking thyroid functions. Well, I'll check them if a woman calls and said jeez, I'm getting a little more tired or I'm getting constipated or something. But my annual serum testing always includes a TSH of free T three, three T four and if she's receiving thyroid treatment, as many do, I'd have to make a guess that a third of the women that I've been treating for menopause are already on and been on or newly on thyroid hormones. If I'm treating them that I want to get a reverse T three also, and I have gotten a basal reverse T three on my initial testing to make sure that they have that
