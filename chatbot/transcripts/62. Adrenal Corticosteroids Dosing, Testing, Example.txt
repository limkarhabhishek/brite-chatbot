transdermal cortef absorbs really well. And oral also absorbs well and oral is not a problem. So we're talking about cortisol or hydrocortisone, and the dosage forms that comes in and the transdermal oils, I'd recommend a 58 milligramme per millilitre, approximately two milligrammes per drop, and then also the tablets, they come in five milligramme tablets, and usually take them with a meal, because everyone will recall that cortef can irritate the stomach or cause, you know, a weakness of the stomach lining, that opens it to inflammation. So you don't want to take it right in the middle of a meal, and then just occasionally, we'll give them a two o'clock in the afternoon, when there hasn't been a meal, that someone better have a healthy stomach for that and you're not giving them long range for most people I've treated so very often don't run into a challenge with the stomach, then how much might say between five and 15 milligrammes or even up to 20 milligrammes per day, and they can be in divided doses in the morning and about 1pm And some women get that afternoon dip, and that's what we're trying to address. They'll tell you about it. they'll really appreciate the cortef you go to in the morning, and then they'll read when you question them. They're gonna say, Yeah, I'm getting a little stilted getting tired in the afternoon, so you, so you divide those doses, and so you could start off with five milligrammes every morning, and maybe not five milligrammes around 1pm. And this doesn't have the highly specific symptoms like low estrogens, hot flashes, 75% of the women. And excessive oestrogen, breast tenderness, 75% of the women are gonna get breast tenderness, but the 25% don't Well, cortef is different in that way. It doesn't have specific symptoms. In fact, if you got an overdose of cortisol, you know, a lot of people aren't going to notice it. And worse than that, for you, and for them. Very, very many people get high on cortisol. It's one of the reasons it's challenging for anyone physician who's put someone on corticosteroids. Like say, of course, prednisone, for example. It's challenging, and the patients often enough complain about coming off those corticosteroids because they felt so much better on them. But that's the same thing that can happen with oestrogen, you feel high, but that high is not good, because you're dealing with overdose. But the Getting back to the point here, you're not going to get distinct corticosteroids symptoms, except what I've noticed, is the people who really need corticosteroids, they'll often feel better, and they'll know it and they'll say, Thank you, Doc, I like this stuff. And shy of testing, I don't like to go above and I'm repeating this 20 milligrammes in any 24 hour period. So, if you, you can titrate, like if you give them if they're very tired, and they don't feel well, and they have malaise in they got low corticosteroid test levels. And by the way, I have never treated a patient with cortisol, cortisol or cortef. Unless I see a 24 hour urine hormone test, so it's not like I'm thinking, Oh, someone's tired. I think I'll give him some cortisol. I just don't operate like that. I know people do but I just don't willy nilly give people credit card debt, because you know what, you can do it that you can suppress an adrenal gland, or you can put someone into overdose and long term consequences of suppressing an immune system and getting osteoporosis etc. The Legion of possible side effects and adverse effects is quite long. So take it back to the basics that I'm talking about. If you give them five milligrammes in the morning and they don't say, Gee, I feel better, you can go up to an additional five milligrammes around 1pm. If they say, I can feel this stuff, you still may want to go up to 10 milligrammes the next morning, I'm putting question marks in front of those because this is a discovery process, when I wouldn't increase that any more frequently than one a week apart, and you put them on the 10 milligrammes in the morning, additional and they go, Wow, I do feel better. I like that this 15 milligrammes is good for me, or maybe even taking them up to 20, so, an additional 10 milligrammes at 1pm 10, in the morning 10, at 1pm, and they say, Gee, I really appreciate this doc. And so once I've gotten them up to that in about two weeks after that, I want to test those corticosteroids just to make sure I don't have them on excessive dosages. Then the question is, how long you keep them on there. And before we go to that, transdermal it doesn't matter what transdermal whether you take it with food or not food, but we will have to turn to transdermal if they've got inflammation of the stomach, or GERD is the dose determined by symptom alleviation. I've already walked through this in a general sort of way. The symptoms aren't odd because they're there, but they're not obvious. And then you confirm by testing and of course I put the seal of significance on this particular slide because you will. If you do work with hormones long enough and work with the old people and fatigue people on you know, you're gonna run into corticosteroid depletion. A lot of people have it but it's subclinical, and a lot of people have more than subclinical when corticosteroid depletion is functional. And natural Addison's 24 hour urine hormone testing, and you want to see that th e th five Alpha THF, between 2003 1000 minimal and again, restoration of the oestrogen progesterone antigens and often the thyroid will result in most likely on its own repleted. corticosteroids sort of magical when you have someone on corticosteroid treatment, watch for the time to titrate down and titrate off. Because I find that happens. And I don't have anyone that I've had on eternal cortef. That doesn't mean that they're not out there. But I've never had to do that. Now if you're titrating someone down in off of cortisol, watch for the return of fatigue, that's going to be a signal that maybe they still need some. And ultimately you're going to confirm by testing. So I want to tell you about this as a dental technician. She was 51 years old when I first encountered her. She was quite stressed as a hygienist and she had already been treated with cortef for approximately a year and she was still tired. And she also had the onset of very significant menopausal symptoms, and we treated her for that and this is her November of 2008 initial cortical steroid part of her 24 hour urine hormone test, that's all I'm showing you and she was and five milligrammes of cortef. In her cortisol was 86, that's pretty good and cortisone was pretty good. And then liquid, her metabolites added up to 2523, that's between 2003 1000 That's not quite in that 3000 or 5000. But we wanted to do an experiment, and we wanted to raise that up to see if we get some well being because we'd already helped her with her ovarian hormones, and sure enough, we increased to just seven and a half milligrammes a day, notice I didn't even jump to 10. And look what that did. That was the magic number and abroad or up to 5686. That's robust, that's just in six months time, and then in January 2010. So that's 10 months later, three quarters of a year later, we had tapered her off. So she was on zero cortef. And look at her numbers. And then from that point on, we've never haven't given her this and we test her annually because she's on ovarian hormones. And she's never needed cortisol again. So that was a big boost to her. The part that you're not seeing is between the first test result that you see there and five months later, her well being had increased very substantially. So I want to let you know that ordinarily, you wouldn't necessarily like if I encountered an original 24 hour urine at 2500. And I saw that her androgens were low. And her estrogens and progesterone low because this was her first menopausal visit, I would have gone I'm not going to treat the 2500 because nine times out of 10. If I just treat and replenish the estrogens progesterone in the androgens. I'm going to watch that corticosteroid come on back to normal on its own. So it's a very interesting story there and nine times out of 10 When I see a 2500 or something in that vicinity. I know she's depleted and she's been under stress. You can bank on that. But I won't necessarily treat her but then there will be the one out of 10 that I will and you'll sense it, they're gonna seem a little more ill a little more fatigued. Doesn't make total sense that it's just from androgens and oestrogen, etc depletion. So the cortef was deseed, as I said, and then there was a slight question with her because we had her and substantial amount of oral progesterone did it convert matter and 200 milligrammes, which is an amount of progesterone that I've haven't used ever since then? And we did wonder, because the biochemistry says, If you give someone oral progesterone, you give them substantial amounts of progesterone, wouldn't they convert the progesterone to cortisol, but I've been assured by the laboratory director that I've worked with hand in glove for a long time, that it just doesn't happen. And he's seen a lot of these tests, but this was a curiosity to me. Did her oral progesterone result in corticosteroid replenishment on its own corticosteroids don't need him very often.

There's adrenal depletion, the Lor this adrenal fatigue that we hear so much about, amongst laypeople and physicians, it's real. I mean, doesn't it make sense? We're at the mercy of our new indiscretions of nutrition One, the toxicity that we're exposed to and having detoxified the too much or too little exercise that we may have done and the elephant in the room is the biology that stress response that it's so imperative I find for my own self to have really worked on my tool bag. So yes, the stress occurs and the stress occurs in me. But my God, I'm a million miles from when I began that journey in the tools that I have to deal with internal stress and thus external stress. It looks like external stress. It's mostly the internal stress that triggers the biology of fight or flight and depletes all of our hormones. So why wouldn't there be adrenal fatigue? Too much fight or flight? Lots of adrenal fatigue out there.
