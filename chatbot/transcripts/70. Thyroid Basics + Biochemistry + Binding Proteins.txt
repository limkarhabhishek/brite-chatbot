I'd now like to talk to you about some additional topics, and I know that some of you are already good at these topics. And for some of you this might be new information or additional information that will assist you. I know that some of you know quite a bit about thyroid hormones so common that it's introduced to a complementary physician to a functional physician to an integrative physician very early on to a holistic physician early on in our careers, hypothyroidism, so common is something you can do so much good within functional hypothyroidism. It's one of the first concept, but I'm gonna review it with you and, you know, skip it. If you already know a lot about that, right. So, you know, thyroid is part of a system just like everything's part of a system that is includes our brain and our Pituitary and the actual, it's part of the whole glandular system in row single out that thyroid right there and pretty isn't it amazing sitting on the other side of that larynx, and I have a special affection for thyroid glands because I had a mentor and they spent three months preceptorship with as a senior medical school world expert. In thyroid Dr. Joseph Mann Ivanovic was astounding physician in astounding human beings. So we all may have some of these mentors in our past in the amount of gratitude that I feel for the many mentors that I've had, including this expert in thyroid. So I got an early introduction to paying attention to that thyroid gland, or he didn't teach me about functional thyroid deficiency, because they weren't that wasn't part of the vocabulary or the the issues of his day. This was in 1968, when we had the preceptorship. So you know, there's the microscopic, and you see colloid, or actual forming of the thyroid hormones within the thyroid gland. I'm not going to go into that. But what are the thyroid glands produce that really matter to us? Well, they take the amino acid tyrosine, and they build upon it, and they add iodine, and my god, there we go tea for levothyroxine Rockson. Oh, yes. And then if you remove one of those iodine ends, you get the super potent thyroid hormone called Triaud with arginine, T three, and then reverse T three is just by moving the position of that molecule, the body change a potent hormone triiodothyronine into a non functional, non potent hormone called reverse T three. Well, that's one of those protective mechanisms get into hyperthyroidism, what can the body do? It can start jacking up the amount of reverse T three. And so I find all of those very relevant, and all it's done is just change the position of the eye. Now, there are several other iodinated molecules that are generated that have little or no biological activity, so I'm not paying attention to them. But reverse a T three is an example that we do pay attention to. And I include that is part of my initial thyroid screening, and subsequent thyroid screening. Because what happens if your body is producing a lot of reverse T three, why is it doing that because it's probably been dealing with an overdose of thyroid. So it's a protective mechanism we can do and then all these steroid hormones and thyroid is a poorly soluble in water hormone. So 99% of it to get distributed to the whole body, which is very important is of T three and T four circulating the blood is bound to carrier proteins. And most of the T three and T four is bound to the thyroid binding globulin, TBG. And that's preferred and there's also trans fat Retton and also albumin. Yeah, albumin will bind proteins. There's a lot of albumin, it's not very specific to any of these hormones. And it's not about the bind. The bond isn't that intense, nowhere near the specificity and strength of binding of TBG for example, for thyroid hormones, and these hormone binding globulin ZZ have a complex interaction and interrelationships and we want to pay attention to that because it's going to affect you. Sooner or later you work with ovarian hormones and you're going to wind up having to examine the thyroid status because if something bumped up that SS as hBg Oh, oddly enough, it may be an excessive dose of thyroid that they were on because excessive levels of thyroid hormone can increase sh VG and thus decrease the free estrogens and free testosterone and thus lead to diminished function of those two classes of hormones diminished libido, for example, onset of hot flashes, just because someone got too much thyroid hormone. This is all about the mining globulins and you can get into excessive levels of estrogens, that they can increase the TBG and thus decrease the T for, for example, birth control pills that put as I mentioned before, a woman who is at the peak of her oestrogen production and you're giving her additional extra dial. So you're really giving her an overdose of oestrogen. So what are you going to do about that? Well, she can protect herself by binding up more of her estrogens. And she's going to use section one binding globulin to do that. Well, excessive estrogens can also increase the thyroid binding globulin. So you can get women on birth control pills start developing some functional hypothyroidism. So these things are interrelated. And you want to pay attention to the Gestalt here is, you know, what do our mentors tell us about function? It's a web, Dr. Jeff bland, My God, what I've learned from this, this wonderful, amazing man and leader in the world of functional medicine, oh, my god, Jeff land, and what he's created in the course of his lifetime. And he has taught me that these as a human being, we are a web of complex interactions, and you better address the web if you want to be successful with a patient or your own health. So excessive levels of cortisol can decrease thyroid binding globulin and thus increase t four and you might have heard when I was talking about the corticosteroids before is that you got to get the thyroid and the cortisol in balance. And this is because if you're not unbalanced, this is one of the intricacies that can enhance an unbalance. So you know, what's the takeaway on uncovered what these hormone levels are? And if you got any rebalancing or restoration to do replenishing to do do it, and read tests to see if you're getting more into reasonable ranges. That's the world of hormones in a nutshell. I'm cover insufficiencies and imbalances and replenish and get them up to reasonable. That's all that's going on here. So I can tell you about the complexities of the binding hormones. And the sex hormone binding globulin can become a real issue and treating women in menopause. So this is just not a theory and it's not I'm not I'm lingering on it for a reason.
