As far as the treatment of hypothyroidism Well, this I'm flashing up another doctor that's meant a lot to me I get to shadow doctor gave me a long time ago in his office. And he's a major contributor to our medical knowledge base. If you haven't seen his textbook of holistic medicine, you merely need to look over at my shelf there where I've got Dr. Gabe, his new book on nutritional medicine. In fact, I think if I look into this camera, you're probably going to be able to see that book. And then bookshelf. Why am I lingering in that because it's just a wonderful resource. And one of Dr. Gay B's great gifts is he loves the medical literature. And so you want to get a direct look into the medical literature. This book on nutritional medicine is so researched, is outrageous. That's how he is born and bred into scientific literature. wonderful resource. Well, I remember the day we walk into this patient's room, we were walking from exam room to exam room seeing patients, and he was examining this patient and getting her history. And we walked out of the room after he was done with that. And he said to me, this woman is hypothyroid. And neither one of us have any idea of what to write down on a prescription pad because we don't know how much thyroid she actually needs. But no worries, we're going to have them find their own dose, we're going to have her find her own dose. And at the time that he told me that I was startled, because he went to medical school and I went to medical school and no one had mentioned go find your own dose. But it made sense to me, he described the process perfectly me and and at the time, he was very fond of armoured thyroid, and you have the patient start out on one pill a day for 10 days or two weeks. And if that seems like a long period of time to wait, it might be the right amount of time to wait. And then they don't feel better, you have them increase their dose to one and a half pills for another 10 days to 14 days. And if they don't feel all the way better, you haven't increased to two pills a day, half hour before breakfast, even up to two and a half or three. But if at three, they start developing symptoms of hyperthyroid and of course you instruct them on what those are, they feel jittery, felt like they had too much coffee, they got a tremor, they got heart palpitations, they feel all wired, that's a signal to them, that they had too much. And so you haven't backed down. And that's how they find their own dose. And then once they have done that, you know, that's dose titration. So to speak, titration dose determination, you start with the lowest dose you gradually increase. So hormone dose adequate to alleviate symptoms of insufficiency, oh, that's a key. People feel thyroid, if they are hypothyroid, they're going to feel better, they're going to feel more awake, they're more energy, they're going to feel keener of mind you're gonna feel happier, it's a big mood thing. They're not going to feel as cold. This these are very dramatic things. That's why those determination works by identifying and alleviating symptoms of insufficiency while backing down from or falling shy of symptoms of excess. And then let's look at how we would treat the my thyroid protocol. Well, I would start this patient out with levothyroxine. And I would gradually titrate up if the test results suggest that a patient is a decent converter. And this patient is a decent converter, and I'll explain myself around why I choose levothyroxine in most cases, and it looks like because relatively speaking, this patient has produced a decent amount of free T three. And even in relatively speaking they're free T four is even a little lower than free T three, so I think they're doing some conversion. And let's talk about levothyroxine. And it's supposed to be a synthetic hormone, but it's actually bio identical. It's the pure T for now, what's not pure about it is they have figured out that people need to dose determine one by hook or by crook, if the doctor is manipulating their doses time after time or the patient themselves doing it. So there's a lot of colours and it's only the 50 microgram tablet there that is actually white and doesn't have these coloured dyes and stuff. So I've never prescribed anything but the 50 microgram and I have them titrate using that 50 microgram because they don't want the colour dyes and stuff and it's generic levothyroxine and the tablets are scored so you can easily break them into these tablets or 50 micrograms of the white ones and no matter what brand you're using, they've chosen to keep it uniformly the 50 microgram being white, and I usually start if I think someone needs thyroid imaging, they started 50 micrograms and titrate up by an additional 25 micrograms every 10 days. When I left Baltimore and Dr gave his office at that time, I started having my patients increase every week, because I thought, hey, we can go a little faster than 10 days to two weeks. And I quickly learned that now better, you should wait. Very often, you got an adjust a lot of things that you've got to adjust to the reinstitution of decent thyroid hormone levels. And you don't want to push that process, because you're just going to get into challenges. If you push that process, so I'm, I'm quite content and telling people it's gonna take a while. And I'm gonna tell him how long it's gonna take a couple of weeks minimum, I definitely don't go higher than 125 micrograms or 150 micrograms and never had to, you know, only go up that high, if they definitely don't have any tremor, palpitations, or a pulse rate increase or increase in anxiety, etc. And usually 5075 micrograms, maybe 100 micrograms of levothyroxine and works just fine. Again, they're going to dose determine, and then once they land on what they think is the right dose, I'm gonna repeat the testing, just to make sure, but here's a different configuration. And this is the hypothyroidism they point out where it looks to me like there's a decent amount of t for TSH is reasonable, but as a hint that there's insufficient thyroid hormone in general. And the free T three is less than what I would expect with that amount of T fee for I think there's a conversion issue there. I'm going to also add to the T four regimen long acting T three, lie Oh thyra Nene. And when I expect poor conversions, let me tell you a little bit about Lao Theron, it definitely has a shorter half life than T four. And commercially, the short half life T threes are called sight ml, and they come in two dose strings five and 25 micrograms. And you get some compliance issues when you're prescribing these because especially in the more substantially deficient thyroid patients. And I'm thinking now of a woman that I first met up with and found her to be hypothyroid when she was 19. And very significantly, so she has to she does use site a mill, and she has take it four times a day. Whereas usually the morning dose of T four is all you need. It lasts and hangs around longer, but not the T three. So there's a tremendous value in long acting T three because who can remember to take something it's only the highly motivated now do people get highly motivated? You betcha B and this young woman when she found that her life normalised and she could use that brilliant mind she had and work and be a major contributor and be happy. I like to try long acting T three because a lot of the people who are not so sensitive that they've got to get into these very careful tighter, four times a day, three times a day dosages, long acting T three carries 90% of my patients who need T three, and we start titrating them at five micrograms, and just have them keep on increasing on up. And ultimately the T four and T three dosage can be compounded into a single capsule, which is more cost efficient, and into an extended release capsule. So when you're fine your dose and your test and you're satisfied with the test results, you supply that single release capsule, or you can keep them independently levothyroxine is not expensive. And the range of need is wide. I have women who are on five micrograms, I got women on 50 micrograms and anything in between. So it's a kind of thing that you've got to dose determine and test. And then I was taught that whenever we're using T three, including long acting T three, we should always have some T four on board that has worn out for me. I haven't I don't have any patients on pure T three. And of course I'm testing them like hawks. So I find that I do as I was taught and it bears itself out to testing is that whenever I have someone on thyroid, I've got him on T four alone. And that will carry a certain percentage of patients or T four plus T three and I even have patients and some poor sign thyroid and levothyroxine going when you start looking at it it's boy sir was a popular drug is a popular drug. It was one time it was the most popular drug in the United States. With one exception, the Lipitor oh my goodness gracious
