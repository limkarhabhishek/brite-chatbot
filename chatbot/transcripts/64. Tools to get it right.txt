And I'm going to go through them step by step. So let's start with that first field there. And I'm going to illustrate below that you have a drop down list. You could enter bias progesterone DHEA, or testosterone here. We're choosing the biassed, of course first, and then once you select bIast, it automatically knows because this is the second consultation calculator and it knows already that you your original prescription was 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 20, so, it fills that in for you, including the milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per drop. So that's an auto enter right there. And then we're going to look at that second field that you want to work with. And because she's going to tell you well, how many drafts did she actually determine, helped her with symptom alleviation. She made it up to the full six, three and three, this particular example, this particular patient, so you enter six, because she told you, that's how many she was on, and when you multiply six times 0.44, you learn that this patient was on 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalent per day. That's the upper limit of initial acceptability that I have prior to testing. Don't want a woman to go higher than that without testing here, and then you want to select the symptoms she may have, let's say that she had symptoms of minor insufficiency. Let's say she says to you, Doc, gosh, I'm so much better. This is great, my my hot flashes are reduced about 80%. I'm still getting some hot flashes at night. And I can tell it's not quite all the way so you have selected from the drop down list the minor insufficiency, because that is a minors, you can also do a moderate insufficiency, and major insufficiency and you'll evaluate that, or you could have minor access, maybe she's reporting that you had breast tenderness that would be minor excess or moderate excess or major excess. Those are the choices you have when you touch the symptom drop down list. Well, in this case, she had symptoms a minor insufficiency. So what we're now about to do is we're going to keep the drops, we're gonna drop them down to the standard drop to five total drops of the bias per day two in the morning and three in the evening, because that's optimal, and then this is going to automatically calculate how you achieve that. And in order to get that to five drops, you've got to increase the milligrammes per millilitre, and that's exactly what this calculator did. It automatically entered the new formulation if she does two drops in the morning, and five drops in in the evening of 41 milligrammes per millilitre, keeping the ratio the same at 20 at 41 milligrammes per litre is going to have a different milligrammes equivalent per drop is 0.6, so, you multiply five drops times 0.6, and you get her total dose has gone up a little bit, to 3.0. So, you're, you're knowing you're knowing what's happening, you're flying at a high altitude here, but she could have absorption issues, just because she's a 3.0 doesn't even mean she's made it into the normal range and 24 hour urine hormone test, you are going to find out and look at that the milligrammes per millilitre has gone up, the ratio has stayed the same, and, of course, if the milligrammes per millilitre has gone up, so has the milligrammes of estradiol equivalents per drop, and that's what multiplied by five, that's what the three is Lulu difference, she had symptoms of minor insufficiency, so you're increasing your dose from 2.6 milligrammes of estradiol equivalents per day to 3.0. That is not a dramatic increase, it's a minor increase. Based on her minor symptom insufficiency, you're going to get a message pop up, that it's acknowledging that it's above the 2.6 ideal and so that you're going to be going down the path of testing her at the right time, and it's just telling you that and it's also saying to you in the notes department, that the milligrammes applied, doesn't necessarily translate into the milligrammes that enters the body. So it's just telling you that but it's caution you that you want to test this woman because she's above the common range, and then you click on add to our x and what this does, is it goes in and sets up the first part of that prescription, and that's a little difficult to read, but there it is. What it's saying is ml mellow biassed that's menopause method oils biassed 41 milligrammes per millilitre at 20 dtd. Eight and a half millilitres because that's the standard we want for buyers progesterone, and DHEA. Not for testosterone that is going to deliver five millilitres and the thing is five drops, two drops in the morning, three drops in the evening, and that's what that says, and you're building this prescription because biassed isn't the only thing that you're going to give her
