I'd like to talk about sex hormone binding globulin you hear me drop little warnings about this one, because it's pretty rare for it to go awry, but when it does, it can be quite the clinical challenge. What it'll do is it'll elevate and then the question is, is it going to come back down again once it's elevated. So let me give you some more information about this. Our bodies transport fat Seibel steroid hormones, as I mentioned before in the aqueous bloodstream, primarily by linking them to plasma proteins. And sex hormone binding globulin is binds primarily estrogens and androgens and cortisol binding globulin primarily binds progesterone and corticosteroids. And both sex hormone binding globulin and cortisol binding globulin have high affinity and high specificity for the aforementioned hormones. albumin, which is present in an abundant amount has low affinity and low specificity for steroids, but a high degree of prevalence, a lot of it. So this is how these hormones are transported around in the serum. And then of course, thyroid has thyroid binding globulin and thyroid also binds to sex hormone binding. If there's too much thyroid disease, binding globulin ZZ are very interrelated, and birth control pills because they add additional hormones to young women. At a time when they're at the peak of their own hormone production. They often raise that sex hormone binding globulin and often as a result of that they bind up more free testosterone in the in the young women get lesser libido. Now, most often, the sex hormone binding globulin is going to decline when the oral contraceptives are withdrawn. Bravo, that's exactly what we want. And you know what, on occasion that elevated sex hormone binding globulin stays elevated. And I've had histories of women who wound up having at the time of menopause elevated six hormone binding globulin is the only cause we could possibly see was the birth control pills they took as long as 20 years prior. So this is a very significant issue. When you've got an elevated sex hormone binding go I mean, you're binding up more of the hormones that you're administering to a woman. This is why this becomes an issue. One consequence of excessive dosages of estrogens or androgens is that the body will protect itself by increasing the binding so it will increase sex hormone binding globulin. So look out folks, when and if there's overdosage is discovered. And the hormone levels are reduced, the sex hormone binding globulin levels may decline. And they may not. Some of the more challenging cases I've ever run into in menopause. We're looking at some of the maximum challenges. There's one more that's of higher challenge. And that's treating women who've had breast cancer in their past with bioidentical hormones, but this is number two, this doesn't have the same safety issue. No, this is not an illness. This is not a safety issue, but it's a hassle issue. I can tell you that is the testimony of the women who have this issue will let you know. So again, some of the more challenging cases I've ever had it resulted from a sex hormone binding globulin that would not come down without pharmaceutical treatment of it. And I just haven't figured out how to do it with non pharmaceuticals and you can use Dan is all in relatively low dosages, Dan has always given very robust dosages, relatively speaking, for endometriosis, for example, well, you can use low dosages of Dancehall, somewhere between five and 15. milligrammes QD and then you monitor the success of your Dancehall treatment with serum sex hormone binding globulin. So this is why I say I always get an initial sex hormone binding globulin in my initial screening work because I bumped into this issue downstream enough times that that's why I've made it a policy to test out that sex hormone binding globulin in the initial screening bloodwork. And here's another thing don't prescribe excessive levels of bias or testosterone, or even progesterone and thyroid because they too can jack up that sex hormone binding globulin. If you don't do it, you're not going to get into this problem. Again, it's not an illness, it's primarily a hassle, and certainly do not succeed 2.6 milligrammes Westerdam equivalent per day a bias without testing, as I've shown you, it doesn't mean that that's the, that's the absolute upper limit of how much bias you're going to need no way you're often going to need more than that. But don't exceed 2.6 without getting your first read of how that's behaving in a woman's body. And you test everyone, even women who are on low dosages because although it's rare, you can be fooled by lower dosages and women who have super absorption my God. It's like their skins are suction cups, just sucking up the warmth that you put on there. And I'm showing you the images of those slides when I was demonstrating to you how prone to miscalculation. One can come if you rely only on dosage strength and a dosage is administered. No, there's so many variables around absorption that we simply must test and ultimately use test. And I do wish you luck if that sex hormone binding globulin elevates. Now not to scare you, again, it's not a health big deal is just a hormone adjustment deal. Here's a reference on sex hormone binding globulin. And the takeaway on this is that if hormone doses are too high, sex hormone binding globulin is going to rise and they're going to confound your treatment of a woman and menopause unless you suspect it. And excessive oestrogen treatment, excessive testosterone treatment, and even progesterone and thyroid will raise the sex hormone binding globulin. So you always test for it. And then you're difficult to solve cases, try and remember it. I mean, doctors consult with me all the time. And we run across this issue in only once per doctor, anyone ever is run into this issue tends to remember it really excellently. And I'll tell you, one of the more common pitfalls is the standard bias ratio you've seen is at 20. And it's one of the most common ratios. And for reasons that I don't totally understand, because it never did this, I've seen physicians and nurse practitioners tempted to change the ratio to get a little more estradiol in there. Well, you are then super obligated to test because increasing that estradiol a little bit because it's eight times more potent than the estriol can raise the total potent estrogens quite a bit. So we are very careful and specific around how to change that ratio. And we do so on the basis of testing only, I never change the ratio just shooting from the hip. And I always do it on the basis of testing and then you want to retest because as I've demonstrated in other parts of this, this education programme, you raise that estradiol a little bit in the ratio, for example, you take it from 8020 to 6040. That's quite a huge increase. And because you're dropping yesterday off from 80% to 60%, and you're increasing the estradiol from 20% to 40%. That's enough of a race to look out folks. And again, it's something commonly I've seen in the physicians, they advisors, they first start messing with the E 3d to ratio without really understanding the details of the potencies and without using the calculators and we've got a calculator to do this for you
