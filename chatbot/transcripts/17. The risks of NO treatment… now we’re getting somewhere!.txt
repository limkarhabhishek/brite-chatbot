There's another bottom line, the risks of no treatment whatsoever. Let's dive into that subject. Because without sufficient ovarian hormones, and other hormones, there's a loss of energy. There's disturbance in sleep, what kind of effect? Does anyone new lose a night's sleep lately? You tell me what the perpetual insomnia effect on health that has the effect on mood, and thus how you navigate through life and thus how the stress that you encounter and how you react to the air respond to that stress. And then libido, of course, is diminished. This is a sure thing. And then the weight issues in the when we get down to weight issues, we're really getting down to metabolism. And thus, we're talking about the function of everything. So a woman is putting on weight, she's lost Metabolic Fire there. And nothing works as well without sufficient energy. And the biological changes can go deep, as you can see by the flab that can replace the triceps area, and that so many women are very uncomfortable about and really here we are, again sarcopenia healthy looking musculature and sarcopenia muscles that have gotten a lot thinner because there's so much loss of muscle mass. And then I you will hear me repeat this many times. And it's the effect of lost muscle sarcopenia on the levator AI. Because when that muscle weakens, you no longer get the pelvic floor support. So women who are doing pretty well with bladder function, as they start losing that love a Terranea and I they start getting more and more prolapse. And that's just one more risk factor for repetitive bladder infections and incontinence, ultimately leading to adult diapers. And then you put into that mix, the vaginal atrophy and the easy irritation in the urethral meatus. And inflammation. They resume Adas and you got a recipe for adult diapers. And why am I lingering that? Because this is what the women don't like. This is one of the reasons we're doing this work is if you can help a woman avoid adult diapers depends etc. It's a great service. And then of course, the bone. That's healthy bone, there's a micrograph of osteoporosis, and of course, the arteries. Because adequate ovarian hormones does relate to arterial health. And we have more evidence of that as we go on and not to mention the brain. And I can't tell you how many women who've come into my office and their chief complaint was not hot flashes, they were having hot flashes. It was the cognitive decline because you have a high functioning woman who is very engaged in life, and she's starting to lose memory and cognitive function. This is very disturbing. And it can go on to even increasing the risk for Alzheimer's. Let's talk about oestrogen and coronary artery disease. And the essence of this article is that many epidemiological studies show that women we use oestrogen therapy after menopause have significantly lower rates of heart disease than postmenopausal women who do not take oestrogen. This is what is fascinating about this as well as the magnitude of the protective effect of oestrogen is more pronounced among women with high baseline risk of disease. And let's talk about the relative risk of heart disease versus breast cancer in women because the big emphasis has been on breast cancer, women's age adjusted mortality rates of heart disease are four to six times higher than their mortality rates from breast cancer. The emphasis has been put on breast cancer rightfully so. But four to six times more women die from the repercussions of coronary artery disease and arterial sclerosis the die of breast cancer. I mean, it's was always fascinating to me, it was very rare to hear of a woman dying in her 40s Have a heart attack. And yet it wasn't that uncommon to hear of a young man killing over on a tennis court and passing away from coronary at the age of 40. But we all know that as we approach the age of 60, the risk equalises well, what's the difference? Well, hormones is part of that difference. There's other differences as well, even madaket makes a difference. But the mortality rate for women 16 above is six times higher than it is for women dying of breast cancer. So we want not to forget about this and we're dealing with prevention of coronary artery disease. And this author points out that because public campaigns have emphasised breast cancer risks in the effort to promote screening mammography. Many women are far more afraid of breast cancer than have coronary artery disease. We're not trying to get women afraid of coronary Disease. We're trying to do everything we can to prevent it. And there are further references and you'll find them in the appendix and memory, and the oestrogen replacement therapy may enhance short and long term memory and Alzheimer's disease. Quote, the incidences of Alzheimer's disease are low, or its expression is delayed in postmenopausal women with high levels of endogenous estrogenic steroids are those receiving long term HRT look to your Penix for the full article, in reference to that, on neuro protection, here's a review article from 2012 that there's overwhelming evidence of neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects of estradiol and the dire consequences of long term estradiol deprivation. There is a critical period for estradiol is beneficial effect on the brain and it is perimenopause. And also weight gain women on HRT gain less weight than women not taking hormones. And again, I refer you to the Penix for the actual references that I'm referring to here. Bone density, low dose, estradiol low dose doesn't take much. That's a theme that I want you to hear that it doesn't take much to do a world of good low dose estradiol increased bone mineral density and decreased markers of bone turnover without causing endometrial hyperplasia. Yeah, if you're falling shy of causing endometrial hyperplasia, you're dealing with a lower dose. Let's talk about progesterone and bone and actions promoting bone health and women. And here's a name that was standout in this field, Dr. Geralyn Pryor, and she telling us that estradiol and progesterone collaborate within bone remodelling and resorption estradiol slows down the resorption of bone and the formation of bone osteoblasts laying down new bone progesterone, I don't know of any other factor that supports osteoblast, especially to the degree that progesterone does. And in Dr. Pryor's article, she says that we integrate evidence that progesterone may prevent and with antiresorptive, treat women's osteoporosis. What's the best antiresorptive nature's estrogens are antiresorptive. Now of course, there's been pharmaceutical medications developed here, but antirust number one, antiresorptive is oestrogen progesterone stimulates osteoblast differentiation in vitro progesterone prevents bone loss and pre and possibly perimenopause, a woman progesterone co therapy with antiresorptive may increase bone formation and bone mineral density
