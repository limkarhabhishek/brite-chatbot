I now like to talk about adrenal corticosteroids. I've given you an introduction to them with my discussion about the elderly. And cortisol, of course, is the principal corticosteroid. And our need for corticosteroids is very significant. I mean, we must have cortisol to live, and you've all grown up on the consequence of too low cortisol called Addison's disease. And this is not true about all the rest of the hormones. You could even do a thyroidectomy and people would live they'd be in bed most of the time, but they would live but not true about adrenal ectomy and the reason you couldn't survive an adrenal ectomy is the loss of corticosteroids. That's how essential this hormone is and the body prioritises it about biochemistry, for example, from nutrition, the nutritional needs of producing all the steroid hormones that are going to favour the production of cortisol. And you'll see this in the test results. You'll see androgen decline quite a bit sooner years often than you'll ever see corticosteroid decline. It's as if the body is favouring the resources to make sure that there's a sufficient cortisol at the expense of oestrogen progesterone, all the all this steroid hormones, and especially the androgens as well. The corticosteroids, you'll find, well, there'll be normal and then boy, by the time you see declining corticosteroids, you know, there has been a lot of stress. corticosteroid production is a priority. And I've just mentioned this that the other steroids the androgens, for example, will deplete first. And how do you find out about the corticosteroids, you must test. In this case, occasionally, I'll do a cortisol and a fasting blood test. But the body usually has enough oomph in most people to at least squeak out a decent morning cortisol. So traditional endocrinologist use other tests to actually identify low cortisol and they'll get an afternoon cortisol, they'll do a ACTH challenge test, where they'll do a baseline and then they'll inject ACTH and unhealthy adrenal, the cortisol levels will go up as stimulated by the ACTH. And someone who doesn't have any adrenal reserve. That challenge test will not elevate the cortisol. But I've never had to do that. Really, because the 24 hour urine hormone test is so revealing about the corticosteroids, it's yet one more beauty of that test. And if it turns out that you're dealing with a patient who has depleted corticosteroids, it can also be very hard to get the other hormones in balance without getting the cortisol decent. That also pertains to thyroid as well. I mean, I was taught decades ago, that it's hard to get the thyroid regulated if you also simultaneously have low corticosteroids and vice versa. It's hard to get the cortisol regulated if you've got hypothyroidism. So moral of the story is find out what these hormones level are and bring them up to decency. This isn't you don't have to know the details. You just said the process is the same. uncover these depletions. And replenish. I know there's been great fear. I mean, I left medical school with fear of one medication. And it was cortisol. I mean, I was in medical school very soon after I entered medical school very soon after the great corticosteroid tragedy that occurred in the United States, because when cortisol first became available, commercial commercially, doctors were giving it to everybody. Why? Because so many people felt so much better when they were put on corticosteroids. So it's spread like wildfire. And then a few years into it. Baxter started seeing hyper adrenal criticism, excessive dose of cortisol and the humpback and other kinds of osteoporosis, the other consequences, repressed immune systems and put a fear into medical the medical profession so great that it was drummed into us 50 times in the course of the four years that don't treat with cortisol is very dangerous if we just gone through this horrible thing that's happened and it was, but the issue was not treating people with cortisol. The reason I loved it so much is there was such a widespread corticosteroid depletion. It was overdose. And Dr. Jeffries pointed this out in a book called Safe uses of cortisol in the 1970s. One of those historic findings. So once I got over my fear of cortisol, I started using it to advantage. It's not frequent that you use it, but boy, there's a lot of adrenal depletion and it will bring in the corticosteroids if the stress is very severe, so don't shy away from it, just stay within the bumper stay within safe parameters, and if you don't go above 20 milligrammes per day of oral quarter cortef, and I do that in divided doses 10 in the morning and 10 at lunch or after lunch, if their stomach is strong, you're going to be safe. If you have someone who's actually got depleted cortisol, and I wouldn't go above 20 milligrammes and always, when we have anyone on any hormones annually, they're getting a 24 hour urine hormone test annually, and repeating it, because it's important to do that, and especially someone who's on corticosteroids, then you want to be cautious because as I'll illustrate, very often, when you keep treat with cortef, the healing is so profound to the whole being, that you've got to take people off those steroids because they become unnecessary. And so you just got to keep your eye on that. And I wouldn't hesitate treating someone for their whole life. There's no one no physician, no endocrinologist would hesitate dream someone with true and Addison's disease for their entire life. But once you start treating someone with cortef, you keep testing them, there'll be six months, maybe 24, you're in hormone test, to see if they're recovering and then taper them off. And if you do have reluctance around treating with cortef, here's my best shot, relinquish it. Stick your tippy toe or ankles or total body in to the world of cortef and just get it right. That's the only problem. The only problem was overdose. And, you know, we're warned about the levels of prednisone that are treated for people with acute allergy and asthma. Yes, because they're super high dosages. Well, that's not what 20 milligrammes of cortisol is. The prednisone dose is getting up to 60 milligramme. Those are very huge doses and bless them. Sometimes they are needed for acute medicine. Absolutely. But yes, the urgency is or, you know, help those people taper off those kinds of dosages, when you're on 20 milligrammes of actual cortisol, which is not the super intense, strong prednisone milligramme for milligramme. You're dealing in a different ballpark. So, if you have reluctance to treat with corticosteroids relinquish the rack reluctance you want to help people get well, if they're depleted in quarter, steroids are going to need it. Not all the time, but most of the time, and I'll give you the differences. So just look at the biochemistry, progesterone converts to 17, hydroxy pregnenolone, and then to 17, hydroxy, progesterone and then to cortisol. And that's the principal corticosteroid right there. And cortisone is a byproduct of cortisol. And then here's three principal metabolites. There's more to the biochemistry of the corticosteroids, but I want to give you the big stuff in all you're going to do really need to evaluate the health or non health of the corticosteroids. So cortisol, cortisone, and then these three wonderful metabolites. And then also progesterone will go down to corticosterone in aldosterone, aldosterone can become an issue rarely, but it can be in corticosteroid preservation is common. And I've already spoken about this, the depletion does occur. And one thing I always like to do is I like to get the mathematical some of the three principal metabolites, because you not only want to know the cortisol, you want to know what's happening in the process of it being utilised. And you could have a low cortisol, but normal metabolites, that would make me less eager to treat or you could have a healthy cortisol, reasonable cortisol, lowest cortisol, but very low metabolites. In that case, I

know that the body was on a big strain in the body does what it does biochemically. It'll try and preserve, so to speak, the parent hormone. So this is why the metabolites are so important in the evaluation of any of these steroid hormones. So picture that scenario, you've got a normal or low normal cortisol, and you go, Okay, this is fine. I don't have to treat Yeah, but you look at the metabolites. And you see that they're very low, for example, under 2000, and you go, I get it. The body is effort to keep the actual cortisol level up decently, but the metabolites revealing to me that this family is very low, and so I'm going to treat with corticosteroids. So again, in what 24 hour urine 4000 to 6000 micrograms per 24 hours is optimal in a woman, and 3000 to 5000 is quite acceptable in a woman. At times, you're gonna see that depletion on that three months test, and at times it needs to be treated, and many times it does not. Because about that three months, you may or may not have started androgens, and so many times what you'll see if you see low ovarian hormones, including androgens And you replenish the androgens and you're bringing them up to decency, the low corticosteroid is going to repair on its own. And you do not have to treat them. So when I see a 3000 in a woman, even though or 2800 and she's got reasonable energy, I'm not going to treat her with cortef. I know that by treating her low androgens, which if she's if she's low and corticosteroids, you can almost bank on it, that she's low in androgens. The replenishing of her low androgens and low oestrogen and low progesterone. Over time, you'll watch those corticosteroids bounce back into a healthy region. That's why I say when you see the depletion on 24 hour urine, many times you don't have to treat you just take care of the androgens the estrogens and progesterone DHEA. Testosterone, androgens, and many times you're going to watch those corticosteroids bounce back on their own. But you're going to learn the fine line when you go, Oh, that's too low. This woman needs around or, you know, months or how weeks months, however long it is, of cortef is well, especially when the women are super tired and super compromised. So these are the kinds of clinical judgments that you discover over time and because if you're watching this video, you're a subscriber to the menopause method. So you can always consult with me for no charge. Just email me we'll set up a time and we'll do a video conference or even on the phone. If corticosteroids are lower than optimal and oestrogen, progesterone and androgens are very low. I'm just reiterating what I just said. Restoration of the other hormones will often be accompanied by a revival of the corticosteroids without you having done nothing directly about
