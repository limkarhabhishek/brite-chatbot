And then during that first visit, you're at that point where it's time to write that initial prescription and transmitted to the pharmacy and in the menopause method, the initial prescription is always the same. And having said always, there might be way less than 1% where it'd be a little different, but not much. Almost every single woman that ever walks out of my office walks out with this specific prescription bias, 30 milligrammes per millilitre at 28 and a half millilitres one to three draft B ID, to the soft forearms, and progesterone, 200 milligrammes per millilitre, and the organic oils, eight and a half millilitres two to six drops HS to the inner size, that is the initial prescription, that will very unlikely be the continuing prescription, as tweaks to it will be made along the way. But the initial prescription is always the same in this particular method. Occasionally, it will be so obvious that a woman is testosterone and DHEA deficient, that we will give a steady dose not a dose to be determined. Initially, if testosterone DHEA that's an exception, I'll go into that in detail and later video. And then there's a whole education to do with women. Because one of the facets of working with hormones, is they're so individualised that we teach the women how to determine their very own dose and we give them a starting dose based on their individual situation. And we give them instructions on how to determine from that starting dose, what the optimal dose is for them. So here is where we also offer you some tools, because there's a lot of instruction. And you know, so much information happens during that first visit, that if a woman can walk out with some specific tools, and some memory aids, it's a great benefit and makes it's actually makes the process so elegant and really saves many calls back to your office. But what did you say about this? And what am I supposed to apply this. So it begins with giving them their initial instructions. And actually we've narrowed it down to four possible initial prescriptions, the most common one another one for those who are very sensitive, another one for women who are used to robust doses or newly in perimenopause or menopause. And then we have a customised form. And we give a woman one of these four cards, which gives her her initial instructions on how to apply hormones, how much to apply when you apply them for the very first month, the first prescription. And then we also hand to the woman a laminated card that lists symptoms of estrogens, progesterone and testosterone, symptoms of too little of hormonal insufficiency that they're trying to alleviate, and too much symptoms of hormonal access that if they bump into excess in their dose determining process we haven't backed down from so this tool I've been giving out for 20 years, I tell you, women have told me that they've kept this tape to their bathroom mirror, they I'll say to them at the 10 year mark, when it's obvious in the annual visit that they have some they have some tweaks to do to their dosing I say, Well, we're going to dose determine again, you remember that current I gave you that list of the symptoms? Oh, yes, I have it in my bathroom drawer. This is 10 years later. So this is a terrific tool for women to have. And these come in that blue box that all of you who are members, the menopause method, as you join us, you should be receiving a blue box. If you don't just let us know, we'll send you one. And then also, what I found is that it took me about 20 minutes to instruct women where on their body to apply on hormones, when to apply them. And also how to determine those dosages by starting with the low dose and gradually increasing. And after about doing that for a couple of years and spending 20 minutes of each visit. I said gee, this is interesting. And you certainly imperative and useful for the patient. But I wonder if we could film it. And we started off filming my sister in law. And then a couple years later, we did a new iteration with my daughter. And you're now in the third iteration in which we have these videos available for you. You can embed these videos on your own website. And they are instructions on where to apply the hormones and then also how to get that dose determined, right that you can embed them or you can send a link. But these are very important because how many how much of the all of the information that you've given out in that first visit? Does a woman actually remember mean, how much information do you remember, when you attend a seminar in education? Education? It's fascinating in the moment. And then, when the seminar is all finished and done, how many things do you actually remember? Well, we find it very useful to refer a woman back to it when she calls into the office, she has a question about where am I supposed to apply those hormones, refer back to the videos. And these are very useful tools. And then also, we think a visual aid of actually demonstrating the organic oils bottles in in your office. So we take that little demonstration, it doesn't have actual hormones in it, but it does have oils in it, we show them how to shake the bottle, how to remove the cap, turn it upside down, put it on their forum, rub it together. And that one visual aid of how to operate those bottles properly can be very useful for them. That first consultation, there's a lot going on there. And the final action of that first consultation is you schedule return visit for between four and five weeks, if they're going to pick up the prescription from that day from your local compounding pharmacy. Scheduled for four weeks, they'll have enough for a month and by one month of working with those hormones. They're going to understand a lot the process will not necessarily be complete. So four weeks is the good timing. If they're getting the hormones shipped from one of our national suppliers, compounding pharmacies, we scheduled that return visit for five weeks because it'll take about three or five business days for them to actually get their shipment. That first consultation, what art form it is, and I suggest it'll be so supported by you having a checklist and you checking off every item of it so that nothing gets left out of this very important process.
