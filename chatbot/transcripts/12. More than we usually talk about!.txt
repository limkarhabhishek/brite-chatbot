Let's talk about why hormones matter. Well, for one thing, health declines in men and women over time, less than some more than others. And what are the causes of that? We always come down to issues of nutrition, toxicity, exercise too much or too little, or stress. And what that results in is sub optimal nutrition, toxic exposure, exercise and stress, cause excessive oxidation, inflammation, hyperinsulinemia glycosylation, auto immunity, enzyme denaturation. And fight or flight biology galore, which includes an outpouring of empowering hormones and neurotransmitters. This is the consequence of fight or flight biology, an outpouring of hormones and neurotransmitters, adrenaline and cortisol. Oh, yes. Also estrogens androgens, progesterone, estrogens and androgens mobilise wonderfully to support the biology of the stress response, and thyroid Of course, and more, and then also neurotransmitters and more. And what happens with excessive hormonal secretion over time? Well, the principal functions of these biochemicals are really for living. They can and do double up and support fight or flight. These hormonal outpourings are followed by acute depletions which are recovered from and many, but it doesn't continue that recovery does not continue forever. Eventually, repetitive depletions are not kept up with in glandular, quote, fatigue, and chronic depletion results. And of course, we had such an amazing contribution to all this from Dr. Han soya. And what did he tell us that the thyroid output over time diminishes in the adrenal output over time diminishes, and ovarian output declines and testicular declines in neurotransmitter declines. And these are all declining and not necessarily at the same rate, because unbalanced is also common. So with excessive hormone secretion over time, I did mention that stress is the cause. We'll know. I want to clarify that one. It's actually it's the adverse and or excessive internal response to stress. That is the real problem there. We're not going to eliminate stress from our lives. Nor should we, in fact, just a whole wonderful philosophical discussion about the importance of stress, especially when reasonable but the the response does not have to be adverse or excessive, but most often it is. And you do too much of this outpouring over time and the glands and the neurons cannot keep up with the output. And thus, younger folks have more of these precious biochemicals than do older folks who happen to have lower levels of these wonderful hormones and neurotransmitters. Thus, in holistic medicine, pretty early on, we learn about hypothyroidism and adrenal fatigue. And the case in point by the time a woman arrives at perimenopause, there may have already been significant declines based upon what I've been discussing here, the excessive outpouring due to an excessive response, excessive biochemistry of fight or flight, occurring time after time after time. And yet, there is another possible cause besides nutrition exercise, Texas, the universe responds to stress, it's MMP OCP or midpoint mysterious, precipitous ovarian collapse phenomena, otherwise known as menopause. Whether we have a plausible explanation for why this mm speed OCP occurs or not. One thing is it's a fact. And does it matter? Well, brain function can decline from insufficient estrogens. Sleep can be mega disturb from low estrogens and progesterone. Mood can decline from low ovarian hormones energy can decline from low ovarian hormones, not to mention libido, natural buoyancy, hair, skin, eyes energy not to mention muscles, bones and arteries. And the big one for so many. That mysterious weight increase, it just can't seem to be controlled. So there's a major theme going on in menopause medicine. is the theme about risk. And I'd like to also focus our attention on the near certainty of significant problems that take place over time and get more severe as time goes on. And it has to do with the trouble that can occur from low ovarian hormones. This is the elephant in the room. Yes, there is risk. And I definitely plan to zoom in on it and address it as thoroughly, as I think is important to do. But the biggest issue in menopause, to me are the declines that take place over time in the ovarian and other hormones. And, you know, I met up with this in my practice, because not only did I treat young people and middle aged people, I had the privilege of treating elderly people in their 80s and 90s. And my goodness, what they have lost and how much it matters to them. It's one of the biggest things about treating women in menopause. Yes, hot flashes. Yeah, but how about the big stuff, and I'll go in into it in great detail that occurs from mysterious ovarian collapse phenomenon. And, you know, I first met up with this as a medic senior medical student when, oh, boy, we were having fun. The intense book learning had changed to being able to function in a hospital and see patients and I loved it. And we still had to do these lectures from time to time. And I tended to resist those. And then one day, I'm walking into the noon lecture, and it's from a gerontologist, and it's about old people, and I went, Oh, grown. And then my goodness, this wonderful doctor caught my attention really early on, and he said, you know, you all your senior medical students, you've learned 1000, different diagnoses or more. And let me tell you what's really going on in the elderly. They are losing their muscles, otherwise known as sarcopenia. And they're losing their ability to walk and balance themselves and they're falling easily on to osteoporotic bones sarcopenia and osteoporosis. This is a lot what's going on in ageing, do something about that if you possibly can, the bones need these ovarian hormones, and osteoporosis and osteopenia or epidemic, the muscles need these androgens, among other things, and sarcopenia the loss of that muscle is epidemic. And so what happens it leads it leads to instability and very simple acts like turning right in a kitchen and falling onto a tile floor can lead to major problems fractures, and then ultimately to canes and walkers, et cetera. And, yes, with that osteoporosis comes those fractures and not just of the hip, another bane of the elderly women. The vagina needs ovarian hormones in the vaginal atrophy interferes with intercourse, and it irritates the urethral meatus the atrophy itself I'm not even speaking about intercourse. And when you add in sarcopenia of the levator eignet Oh my that amazing pelvic floor muscle that holds up the uterus and the bladder. You got a recipe a formula for adult diapers and yes, women will do what they need to do, but they sure would like to avoid this one.
