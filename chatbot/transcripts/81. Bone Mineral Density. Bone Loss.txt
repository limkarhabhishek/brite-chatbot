I'd like to talk to you about bone mineral density. Why? Because this is a significant concern in menopausal women. And you already know this. And it is remarkable how much osteopenia there is out there. And of course, the remedy is called prevention. And I remember when I was in medical school in our senior medical programme, we had to take a class in prevention, preventive medicine, and I went home. That sounds boring, but really, it was about epidemiology. In those days, it wasn't really about prevention. And, my God, it didn't take me long as a practising physician as a living human being on Earth, wanting to take care of my own health, that my God, a billion pounds of project, I mean, a pound or progesterone was is willing worth a billion Browns of cure. And we all know this in bone mineral density is one of those really important ones, because it's silent until the fracture unless you're testing and we test. And women sign an agreement that they're going to test their bone mineral density, if they haven't done so over. In, you know, from the beginning, you pick up a lot of osteopenia, and some osteoporosis. And of course, I'm far more concerned in most cases, how things are gonna look 1020 years down the line, because I have patients that I've treated for 1020 years in menopause. And we know the progression of this. So we want to catch it early and stop it. And you know, you're very familiar, most likely with these wonderful way of reporting this. And I find that spend a little time to understand it. And you see, it's graphically illustrated, the reference ranges are pretty good now, and they test both the lower spine, the lumbar spine and the hips. And this is great. And then whenever we see any evidence of osteopenia, and sometimes just in general, as part of another panel, we test the urine for are they peeing out any of their bones into their urine, that's a gross way of saying, but my goodness, bone is metabolising all the time. And there's a certain reference range normal amount of bone metabolites showing up in the urine. And you can put out an excessive amount of metabolites in the urine. And in fact, this patient that I'm illustrating right now, she had an excessive amount, in this case, the Oxy period alone, I like that took me a long time to learn how to pronounce that you should try it right now, the Oxy President alone. And whenever we see an excessive amount of bone metabolites showing up in the urine, we wonder why that's happening. And, of course, it can be from hormonal insufficiency and the relationship with the hormones to the osteoblasts and the osteo. Class. And there's other causes of it, of course, and one of the more significant causes, it relates to the metabolic consequences of the food we eat. And you know that you can produce acid as the end product, and acidic metabolite at the as the end product of digesting and metabolising food, you can produce alcohol. And in fact, the vegetables tend to produce alcohol in urine, and don't need buffering, that there are people who are on excessive amount of acid producing diets, some people who are over eating animal protein can produce an excessive amount of acid. And meanwhile, whatever the cause, whether it's dietary or gosh, the biology of the stress response, wouldn't you know it, it's acid producing. So that would be the elephant in this room of acid production. And our bodies have to buffer that you know that the ranges of acceptability of aesthetic variations is very, very narrow, relatively speaking. And so we've got this elaborate, exquisite buffering system if there's too much hydrogen ions popping out, hither and yon. And of course, the first line of defence is lungs. And then there are other lines, the minerals are good buffers. And ultimately, if we can't bring forth enough of the standard first line of buffers, the body has access to the minerals in the bone. And so what do we want to do? We want to see if people are producing too many acidic urines. And so we have three people test the urines, four times a day, it's now in the morning and the night and a couple of times during the day. One reading in the morning is not going to tell you enough of the story. We have them do it for three to seven days, because then you're going to be able to see oh, I can tell overall yes, there's a few alcohol in urines. But this person is overall putting out too much acidity in the urine and vice versa. But as far as osteoporosis goes, it's the excessive amount of acidity that's going to get him so what do we do? We can do dietary interventions and supplement intervene with buffers through supplements. And this is very important to do is one hour Number of treating osteopenia and osteoporosis is to evaluate it, are the metabolites showing up in the bone? And if they are, why are they losing bone? Does it have to do with an exaggerated response to stress where they're inaugurating the biochemistry of the fight or flight response too much, which will melt bones? Or are they too acidic and wet that's amenable to dietary and supplemental adjustments. And there goes, there's a bigger story to osteopenia and osteoporosis. And in my book, happy, healthy hormones. We have a chapter on how to replenish the bones, what kind of supplements to take, what kind of diets matter how to deal with this, this acidity. And I have a feeling that many of you are very well schooled in this, on how to treat osteoporosis and what nutritional supplements count the most. But most of all, catch it early and do what it takes to stop the bone loss and this deoxy period alone, and there are other tests to measure bone metabolites. This is something I like to do early on and I like to keep following until they're not putting out excessive amounts of metabolome metabolites into the urine.
