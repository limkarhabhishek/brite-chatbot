As far as 24 hour urine hormone testing, the time that they take the dosages is no factor at all. In fact, it's imperative that they be taking their dosage just like they usually do. In fact, if they miss a dose during the collection period, we don't want to send in that sample, we want to do this. For solid five, or even seven days prior to the onset of collecting the urine and right on through the urine collection, we want to do taking their hormones, and then there's the analytes. And there's also the metabolites. And my goodness, this is the best bargain in medicine. As far as testing goes, you can get it for anywhere between $159.03 $140 for these gorgeous panels that are going to help you so much. And it's very easy. The patients can do this at home, and they eventually just ship it off. And then the insurance covers some of these labs. And not all you've got to ask about the individual laboratories in the individual patient's insurance as to whether it's gonna get covered. So there's nothing significant other this slide other than that's what a GC Mass Spec looks like. And there's a happy pilot doing the great work. And then here's a good article on 24 hour urine hormone testing, if you want to learn more about it. These are by associates of Dr. Jonathan writes in the Townson letter, and, wow, I haven't mentioned salivary hormones. And I also haven't mentioned this new spot urine testing. Well, I'd like to pause and mention something about them. Because in the beginning, when I started out, I had heard about salivary hormone testing and sure sounded like a good idea to me. And it was inexpensive. And then after a couple of patients, I was confounded by the salivary hormone test results, they did not correlate what was going on in my patients clinically, and there was a major discrepancy there. It wasn't subtle. And it bothered me and I had I have wonderful colleagues, that I have the great privilege of knowing over the course of my career, and I talked to a couple of them and they said, Listen, you want to get into hormones, you got to do 24 hour urine hormone testing. Fair enough. And soon as I started doing the 24 hour urine Rama testing, oh, my did I get it? Yeah. And the great thing was it immediately correlated with exactly what was going on in the patients, with a couple of the discrepancies still present that I mentioned before, but boy, that I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation, yeah, you're gonna test and you're gonna get surprised that clinically, a woman could feel fine, but she's really on too much, but it correlated great with everything that was going on with my patients clinically. Now, salivary cortisol, and DHEA can be useful. Practitioners are sure ordering them. For example, there's a corticosteroid chart, the one on the left, is an rather normal output with the highest output of the corticosteroids in the morning and gradually tapering off into the evening. And then there's some abnormal patterns there. And that's useful, but the 24 hour urine hormone test is reveals so much about the corticosteroids plus the metabolites. I don't know that I could really properly assess any of the hormone families without the metabolites. You need the parent hormone and the metabolites to see what the whole family is doing there. And so it's been years and years and years since I've done a salivary cortisol and DHEA. I felt like I needed to. And then, you know, one exception is in a young woman who's putting out a lot of oestrogen and progesterone, and she wants to get pregnant and you're really wondering, Is she ovulating, collecting saliva every three days and just testing for oestrogen and progesterone, estradiol and progesterone, for example, that can be useful, and that's certainly easier to do than to draw blood every three to four days. Now I like to talk about when to test in irregularly menstruating woman, it's imperative that you test mid luteal, that's when there's this coincidence of the highest of progesterone levels in with high enough oestrogen levels, so you can assess both hormones at that time. Now, this is a trick because how many supremely regularly menstruating young women are going to be coming to you, the young women are going to be coming to you often have period irregularities. So it's tough to test a young woman doesn't mean you won't learn a lot about her. From her your history and your physical exam, you'll learn an awful lot. But in order to get an accurate picture of hormones, she's got to be regularly menstruating doesn't have to be 28 days, or she's regular measuring every 26 days where you just don't collect on days. 19 to 21 you back it up a few days. If she has a longer cycle. This as long as it's regular. You do it on days 2324 It totally depends, but she's got to be regularly menstruating. Unfortunately, these women are usually pretty healthy female why so you don't need to test them. Gotta get that mid luteal. specimen. What about women in the perimenopause, you're going to see very menopausal women come into your practice. And I want to show you what this looks like. The question is, when do you test them? Because I've already shown you that there's a lot of different possibilities. For that oestrogen curve, the progesterone can be flatlined. But that estrogens curve can have new peaks, and new valleys because as they do this ping pong situation between the pituitary says, Hey, turn that back on, and you get a burst. But then there's an interval very empowered to sustain it. So you get a dip and a deep trough. So my suggestion to you is do not test during the pre menopause, because you're gonna wind up with confounding results, like a woman could come in and say, I'm having hot flashes, I'm waking up in the middle of the night. I have to stay awake for a couple hours. You know, she is oestrogen deficient. And yet if you test her and you happen to catch her on one of her peak days, because her pituitary succeeded in getting a blast out of the ovary that it couldn't sustain, you're gonna get funky results. A woman's gonna look at her hormone tests, and she's gonna see high and the oestrogen down as drone. Now how do I know this? Because it's happened to me. I knew the woman was deficient in estrogens from her story, but I caught her on a peak day. And so it was it was a tough sell to say, Look, I know you need oestrogen. And this is why you need it. But you don't have to go through that. It's not valuable to test during the menopause. Their oestrogen output can be so erratic. So why would you test it in the perimenopause at all, so no longer do it. Now in the menopause, you can test whatever the only thing that you want to be sure of is that the dosage is a bit consistent and steady for five days. So for example, if you're doing bi D, bi s, like I strongly recommend that you do you don't want to do it during a week when the woman has left out a few dosages because she just forgot. You want to be religious about it to get the best test results you possibly can. And the whole thing in menopause, you can test whenever except during the couple of days a month, where a woman is stopping her hormones you wouldn't want to test then you want to be on dosages for at least five days. And this is one of those special designated important slides.
