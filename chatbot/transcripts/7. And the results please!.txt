I'm reviewing the value and importance of the checklist. And I want to now delve into the third consultation. And as with every consultation, there is stuff that you can do prior to that third consultation. And one of the most important things is to once again prior to every consultation and follow up, we email that one page questionnaire in which so much of the basic information we want to know the woman is filling out on her time, saving you time and saving her money, the patients really appreciate this. And then the other thing that you want to have prior to that third consultation is the results of the 24 hour urine hormone test. And then you make sure the front desk make sure that you have those for that third consultation. And what do you do during that third consultation? Well, it begins like the processes we've been doing forever ever since we got into medicine, we review the information, in this case that's on the questionnaire and have any additional questions we have for the patient. And we also review the hormone test results. And those hormone test results in the information is going to be the basis of how you calculate what that next prescription is. And this could be the final visit in this initial series of consultations. You're you could be about to write prescriptions that are going to last a woman a year. So the hormone test really helps you in that regard. And it's an excellent time. If you have any questions, in fact, you have any questions anywhere all along the line, because you are a member of the menopause method that you can review every single question you have with me for no charge. So there's a calendar on the Members section, you can just schedule the consultation yourself. And we usually do so by videoconference. And this is one of the services that I love to do. And it's one of the best ways to learn how to handle especially the challenging cases, but you're free to review any of the cases that you have with me. And then when it comes to calculating the dose that's going to last for a year. The math again is involved. And we have another calculator. It's called the subsequent consultations calculator that you start off with the dose that you was on for that second month. And then you tweak it according to her symptoms. And it, it again prints out the suggested dosages based on her symptoms. And that should be enough to last for a year. Now sometimes during the hormone test, you're going to see that the woman just has a little bit too much estriol and when we talk about the 24 hour urine hormone test and the hormones and the metabolites, you're going to see that there is a situation it's not common, where you can bias contain a little too much oestrogen that's theirs for the benefit of that woman. And so you've got to tweak the ratio. And just as an aside, I would not recommend messing with that 8020 ratio unless you have 24 hour urine hormone evidence that it's the right thing to do. And if you do, we have a different calculator that in which you calculate the biassed ratio based on the patient's symptoms, and based on the dosage she was on. Again, in videos, we'll walk you through how to operate those calculators. And that's a fun thing for you and I to do on the phone. When we're looking at these calculators together if you'd like whatever calculator you choose, it's going to print out for your front desk, the exact hormones that you're going to prescribe with 11 refills. Now, there's another item on this checklist for the third consultation. And it's what I've discovered over the course of time, that if there's anything that a woman is going to be left out of her instructions, it has to do with that stopping hormones once a month for a specified period of time. That is actually in the video. But there's so much information that they're dealing with and in these initial dose determination phases, very often. This is the one they leave out. So I put it on the checklist. A woman hasn't been stopping the hormones once a month. It's at this point that you instruct her how to do it and you refer to the video because it's explained in detail on the video. And it's a special item on this third consultation checklist. And then you schedule a visit or her annual appointment one year hence. There is the process. And there we've reviewed the whole checklist that lists all the details of that process. May this serve you well as it serves us so well.
