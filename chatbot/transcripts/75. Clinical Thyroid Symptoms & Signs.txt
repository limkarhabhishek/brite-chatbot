This is Broda Barnes in the history of uncovering hypothyroidism. This is still a classic. And Dr. Barnes was really talking about functional hypothyroidism, where it didn't necessarily have abnormal laboratory values. Of course, when he started out, there was PBIS and stuff. And he wanted to really focus our attention on functional hypothyroidism, where the thyroid wasn't a disease. It wasn't Frank hypothyroidism, but they had less than optimal thyroid function. That means thyroid hormone function, often insufficient thyroid output. And the title of his book was the unsuspected illness. You want to learn something about thyroid. Dr. Barnes book is a classic. So you want to become good at identifying the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism because all these hormones are so potent. It's very rare that you don't if you get too low, or you get too high, you don't get some rather dramatic clinical signs and symptoms, not subtle stuff. And it's peppered throughout the menopause method questionnaire. I'm trying to detect and ferret out hypothyroidism. And basically, the thyroid hormone is about metabolisms that's only function but it's basically about that metabolisms about energy. And with insufficient energy, nothing works well. Or, as I said it in this slide, everything does not work as well don't have enough energy, you don't run an active, healthy, robust gut. You don't run a strong, powerful, highly functional immune system, you don't think clearly nothing works as well, you're tired, you're not don't have enough energy. And there's just for my inspiration, photograph of my beloved mentor, Dr. Joseph Mann of benefit, she's now deceased. And again, I'm repeating what he told me you don't need blood tests to diagnose thyroid dysfunction. And there's a lot of online resources for hypothyroid symptoms. My God, the Mayo Clinic is got a wonderful list of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. So it is the website women in balance, which is in women to women, these are good resources to have in general. And so I'm not going to go through our medical school education in our the depths of because hypothyroidism has got so many signs and symptoms associated with it, but I want to review some of them. And fatigue is one of them, and fatigue, often upon awakening. Because once you get the blood moving with the morning activities, and you get some blood circulation and you get some adrenal hormone output, you can often feel better and feel energetic. So what you're who you're trying to catch, these people wake up super tired. That can be hypothyroidism. And then because the offshoot of metabolism is energy, plus heat, so hypothyroid individuals feel cold. When I moved to Florida, I discovered that the best question I could possibly ask in my initial history was what do you keep your air conditioning at? And you'd be amazed how cold Floridians like their conditioning, they need their air conditioning to be set above 77. That means they don't care if it's 80 degrees, 81 degrees, 79 degrees, even 78 degrees, it's pushing it, Floridians often keep their air conditioning on 7472 It's outrageous to walk into a mall, or a business or have a home are residents of Floridians who lived here all their life, man, those places are cold. But if you walk into a house or you ask your patient in a hot climate, where do you keep your air conditioning and if they say 80 degrees or 79 degrees, these people are cold. And you want to suspect that they're don't they're not producing enough heat die. And what's the main thing that helps them produce heat? Is that right? Because of its intimate effect and metabolism. So on any questionnaire that we have my traditional and practice we have people who take their basal body temperature for three days and it's an axillary temperature, we haven't put thermometer on their nightstand and before they get up to urinate or anything, they wake up in the morning, they stick that thermometer under their armpit. If that thing is 97 Four or below, then it they didn't they're not producing enough heat most likely. Now menopause in low body mass index can affect any symptoms that people have when women have around feeling cold. So it's not the only game in town thyroid as it relates to body temperature. I mean talk to thin people they tend to get colder than people will have a lot of insulation on them. And again, when metabolism is less nothing works as well, including the bowels. So a hallmark sign of hypothyroidism is constipation, you're just not getting the bowel movement, you're not getting the peristalsis is not working as well. Now there's more than one cause of constipation. But when I hear the word constipation, one of the immediate things I want to know for certain is, this person has an adequate amount of thyroid hormone. And in our practice, we're going to solve constipation regardless of its aetiology. It isn't just thyroid related. So whatever it takes, just to review the big stuff. Hydration is very important vegetables, vegetables, vegetables, you eat enough vegetables, you're gonna get enough fibre in there for most people, not everybody to have a normal bowel movement. Prunes is my first go to if we need a little assistance and then magnesium is my favourite go to. And what do you do you take magnesium to bowel tolerance. That means if you keep eating magnesium, there's going to come a point where your body cannot absorb any more. And then it's going to give you the Philips Milk of Magnesia effect. Because filth knock it Magnesia is a very poorly absorbed magnesium. So it stays in there and it triggers peristalsis it I don't know if it's an irritant, but it will definitely increase peristalsis just from magnesium sitting there in the gut. Now my go to magnesium when I want really great absorption is I'll use a glycinate. I wouldn't use glycinate for stimulating the bowel. But I wouldn't use the citrate even though some of that is going to be absorbed. That's great, almost everybody needs additional magnesium. But when I want magnesium for movement, I recommend a magnesium citrate. So they're getting the benefit of additional magnesium and then what they can't absorb, they're going to leave in that gut. And that can stimulate. Now there's other tricks for God Of course, but I wanted to mention that those are then initial things we try. I left out pancreatic enzymes, additional hydrochloric acid, because if you're not digesting your protein, that stool can turn to glue. I mean, a horse's hooves are made out with glues made out of it's made out of protein primarily. So if you're not digesting your protein is left in your stool, you can get hard as rock. So again, digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid betaine hydrochloride, more on hypothyroid symptoms and signs again,

I wrote it down for you that the axillary temperature less than 97 Four is considered to be a cut off and stool transit time on every single patient I've ever seen in my my regular practice, I haven't do a transit time I have great some beats, fresh organic beats into a salad, and a nice little chunk of them. And, you know, eat it 12 hours before your anticipated usual bowel movements. So if you usually have a bowel movement in the morning, eat the beats in the salad 12 hours before. And that means if you see red in that toilet bowl, and you will, that means that those beats made it through the intestinal tract and 12 hours, hey, that's great. But you can even eat the the beats with an evening meal. So it made it in 14 hours. So that's good enough. This is you're showing you a three day chart that we have patients do and that's where an eye chart where they record both the basal temperature and their transit time. And then here's the instructions we have for the three day chart. And if you want this, we can send this your copy of this where you can develop one for yourself in your own practice. And we also have people do a three day food intake. Now a lot of the patients that I see from menopause are also have always already have their family physicians. So these two editions, the three day chart in the three day food intake record, we don't give them to the menopausal women customarily, unless they move on unless they want more from their visits than just dealing with menopause. And these are quirks in my own practice, over the years, you may have all of your patients may be there for the full nine yards, including menopause and everything else that they need more on hypothyroid symptoms in signs, the thinning of the eyebrows laterally, you're gonna see it out there. And that can be a sign of hypothyroidism and a low pulse rate. I mean, you get a pulse in the 60s, a lot of those folks are exercising and they're, they're athletic. And if they're not, and you say well can exercise you get in a week? Well, I don't really exercise. I sit around most of the time. And they've got a slow pulse rate. There's a reason why that's going slow. And then I'm checking them out for tremor during my initial physical exam. And what I do is I have them hold out their arms parallel to the floor, and I look at him and you'll see a tremor and if you don't see a tremor, I'll put an eight and a half by 11 sheet of paper on there and you that'll amplify a tremor. And if you can't see it, then I also touch I come right up and touch the tip of their fingers and you'll feel a tremor that you don't see. I want that as a baseline because many of these patients I'm going to treat with thyroid hormone, and hyper hyperthyroidism if we overdose them that's screams out loud and clear. And most people they don't like hyperthyroidism they feel jacked up is like they had way too much coffee in the morning. Or they're hyper and they feel hyper and are their heart rates gone way up and their pulse has gone way up and they're getting palpitations in their chest, and they get a tremor. And they haven't mentioned reflexes yet, but they play into now we always palpate the glands. Because in large gland is going to be significant. If you palpate every gland, you're going to be able to sense in large band in there. In fact, in Dr amount of enriches mentorship, we had to estimate the actual grammes size of the gland. And really what that helps us do is zero in on gland size. So we gotten really feel 100 thyroid glands, you got a sense of what's normal, and what's a little one large. And he also asked is that gland tender. If that gland is tender, there's light would be inflammation, and that invites the world into autoimmune thyroiditis, or thyroiditis. And I resist that word autoimmune because that immune system is attacking their thyroid gland. And there's always reasons why it did that. And you probably know is functional medicine, interested folks? Why these cross reacting antibodies actually form and then reflexes in the most revealing of the reflexes of the ankle jerk. And the Achilles tendon reflex, and I pay a lot of attention to the return motion. So you tap the hammer and the ankle jerks out. And then it returns in a nice return. Brisk return is a signal of normal reflexes and a slow return which you can detect when you do enough ankle jerks. Look at that it's returning to this basal position, a little slower than it looks like it's doing it in slow motion. That is a sign of a non breast reflex and then cold dry skin. And there's of course, the classic sign of really advanced hypothyroidism is mix edoema. So you look at those lower extremities, and they look swollen. And they look like they got this funny orange peel pit type things that worst case scenario, we're not seeing a lot of that these days. And then this is helpful for the post treatment, follow up exams, if you're treating someone with thyroid hormone, you want to check their pulse rate. So you've had a basal pulse on them when they first came to visit you. And then you're checking them for that tremor. And you're checking them for that Achilles reflex return rate. And we often have patients record their pulse at home, I'm far more interested in people's pulses in blood pressures at home taken four times a day, under various circumstances. And to zero in on that. What is this, it's a simple spreadsheet. And sometimes we'll use it for pulse alone. And oftentimes, we'll use it to record the blood pressure as well. And we'd like them record the circumstances of the time that they're actually taking their pulse and blood pressure on awakening in the morning when stress when relaxed, when you suspect blood pressure, elevation, or pulse rapid pulse. And then also after exercise after a meal, we want to know the circumstances with anxiety, because sometimes slight increases in blood pressure and pulse are explainable by one of these codes in mainly you get a blood pressure and pulse four times a day and you're gonna get a sense for over three days or more days, you're gonna get a sense of do they have an elevated pulse? Is there a pulse at 486 88 all the time are fluctuating up and down from 88. Man that's a rapid pulse. And if you're treating someone with thyroid hormone that could be from overdose. That's one of the most common things we detect. And then we also want to know in this way any medications that are taking
