I want to discuss with you an issue that relates to cardiovascular risk and treating women in menopause. And a little background in this. If you recall that it's very rare to hear of a young woman who mysteriously out of the blue dies of a heart attack. Whereas it's not that uncommon to hear of a young man in his early 40s. Never sick a day in his life. He had a heart attack and passed away, because we know that the incidence of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction is less in young menstruating women in menstruating women than it is in young men of the same age. However, higher incidence in men lower incidences in women of the same age in Toby equalise. At the age of 60. The risk factors equalise and the difference is oestrogen. oestrogen is protective to arteries. And, you know, it's yet another main reason why we love to treat women in perimenopause and menopause with identical hormones, including of course, oestrogen. Now, there is a circumstance that you're going to run into where a woman goes into menopause does not get treated with hormones. And then years later, she decides that she wants to get treated with hormones. And the question becomes, is it safe to do so. And there's mixed reviews out there in the literature, and this is going to turn out to be a little bit of a blur, but the ultimate outcome is the same. We, whenever in doubt, we do the proper diagnostic measures for women who might be at risk. The magic window of opportunity, as it's described in the medical literature is if a woman has not had hormones for 10 years, exact for example, since her last period, then she's at risk for coronary artery disease. And you ought to be cautious when you start administering our hormones for a very unusual obscure reason is 10 years. A magic number not to me, it isn't. Every case must be individualised. Like there are some women who we're going to be at increased risk for a variety of factors, diabetes, family history. And we're not going to say that they're going to be safe, so long as they're under 10 years so that we can start prescribing them estrogens at that point, it might be five years, it might be three years. It's your clinical determination based on the patient's history and testing as to whether or not you want to go further and deeper into evaluating or coronary arteries. So 10 years is not the magic number, the magic window of opportunity. Now, why is that challenging? Well, there is information out there that if you start treating a woman who has not had hormones for 10 years, if she has a thrombus, that thrombus can break loose because of certain elasticity issues in the arteries. And she can have an embolus in a coronary artery and have an MI. Now there is a question about whether or not that relates to oral estrogens only. And not topical questions that are not, but we don't have to solve that one. Because how I proceed is always the same. We take a very, very thorough history. We do laboratory tests. And when we're sitting there in that first consultation evaluating all the moving parts, including what risks does the woman have, if it turns out that she has significant cardiovascular risk? We're going to burrow down into defining that risk. And at that point, it's a referral to a cardiologist. Now, what's the bottom line? Do you have to do a cardiac catheterization to see if she's got a thrombus in there to see if she's got partial blockage? Well, the history is gonna reveal a lot about partial blockage or not, does she have angina, etc. But there's many several women that I've treated who were more than 10 years out that prior to offering them treatment, I wanted to do state of the art cardiologic valuation and you know, that includes minimal and exercise stress, ultrasound, cardiac ultrasound, you put the cut down hard under either chemical or, or physical duress, and you are able to assess flow in the cardiac coronary arteries. Now, there's different tests that can be a nuclear stress test. That can be a nuclear ultrasound. This is up to the cardiologist. And for women, it says stress ultrasound, that seems to be a little more effective in turning up real risk and partial coronary blockage. So what's the window of opportunity? You're sitting there in that first consultation, you're evaluating the various risk factors. If that woman has not had hormones for a certain number of years based on other risk factors related to cardiovascular, you may want to decide to refer her to a cardiologist so you can get the green light as to whether or not she's at risk for partial occlusion, thrombosis, embolus, et cetera, window of opportunity. And what's the corollary to this? Treat women as early as you can possibly treat them for a little over a whole rest of their life? Because they have protection when they're young and they have robust levels of hormones, and that protection disappears when, with their last period when, when the oestrogen levels have declined dramatically.
